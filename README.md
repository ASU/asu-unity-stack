# ASU Unity Stack
Arizona State University Unity StaCK(Standards Compliance Kit). This project is currently under development.

## ❯ Packages in this repository

This repository contains multiple packages which are managed and published using [LernaJS](https://lerna.js.org/). For more information about each individual package, see the README located at the package root.

1. [asu-web-standards-bootstrap-4](./packages/asu-web-standards-bootstrap-4/README.md) - ASU-customized Bootstrap 4 CSS library. This library serves as a structural base for most of the styling across our packages. See the [AsuHeroImage component](./packages/asu-rs-carousel/src/components/AsuHeroImage/AsuHeroImage.jsx) for an example of integrating this package into a Reactstrap component.
2. [asu-brand](./packages/asu-brand/README.md) - Contains ASU-branded global header and footer React components.
4. [asu-maps](./packages/asu-maps/README.md) - React components for configuring and displaying ASU GIS maps, built with react-checkbox-tree.
5. [asu-rs-carousel](./packages/asu-rs-carousel/README.md) - ASU hero images and carousel built with Reactstrap and asu-web-standards-bootstrap-4.

## ❯ Dependencies

In order to build the project, the dev environment needs to have the following programs installed:
- Node.js
- NPM
- Yarn

## ❯ Setup Local Development Environment

### Install Node and Yarn

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Typically, the easiest and most reliable way to manage Node.js and NPM on your desktop is via [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). NVM allows you install and switch between multiple versions of node, which may necessary depending on what projects you are helping to develop.

On MacOS or Linux, you should be able to follow the standard install instructions and run the NVM install script on your terminal:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```
or
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```
After installing nvm, if you get `nvm: command not found` error, close out your current terminal and reopen a new one.

MacOS may require you install the Xcode Command Line Tools, if you haven't already for other development tasks in the past and you do not wish to install the full 4.3 GB Xcode framework:

[How to Install Command Line Tools in OS X Mavericks & Yosemite (Without Xcode)](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)

On Windows, you will need to install [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows). Follow the instruction there for your setup.)

If these methods fail for you, you can always use the traditional install method provided by [Node.js and NPM from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 or to use:
- on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
- on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

Once you have node and npm installed (included automatically with node), verify your node install works correctly:

```
node -v
```
and
```
npm -v
```

You should get printouts of the current version of node and npm that are installed.

To install and activate a specific version of Node for a project, such as the current LTS (Long-Term Support) version of node for this project, lts = v10 as of June 2019:

```
nvm install lts
nvm use lts
nvm alias default lts
```

These three commands install, activate, and set the current LTS version of node to v10.x.

Next, install yarn globally

```bash
npm install yarn -g
```
Yarn is an alternative package manager to `npm`. In particular, yarn provides performance and added features for monorepos and other configuration elements in our project.

## ❯ Quickstart Guide

#### Local development
The easiest way to get started is to spin up storybook as a dev environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ASU/asu-unity-stack.git # clone the package
cd asu-unity-stack # cd into git root
yarn install # do this at git root
cd packages/<package-name> # step into package root
yarn storybook # run storybook
```

See the developer documentation on storybook at https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/

## ❯ Structure
 - packages/[package-name] - NPM package root
 - packages/[package-name]/src - Source code
 - packages/[package-name]/.storybook - Storybook configuration

## ❯ Building, Testing (from the package root at packages/[package-name])

```bash
yarn build # build the project
yarn test # run tests
```

It's also possible to build a package from the git project root with a Yarn workspace command like:

```yarn workspace @asu/asu-brand build```


## ❯ Running end-to-end testing (from the Git project root)

```bash
yarn build # build the project
yarn start & yarn test:e2e # start the testing server and run e2e tests
yarn stop # stop the testing server
```
