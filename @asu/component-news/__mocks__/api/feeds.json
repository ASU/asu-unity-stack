As people around the world try to navigate challenges and revelations that have unfolded in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the faculty involved in the project say it is still crucial to consider the societal impact at large, and what it will mean down the line.\u00a0\u201cOur collection of essays, articles and activities are designed to assist in both understanding and deconstructing the ways in which the pandemic has impacted our lives \u2014 as individuals, families and communities,\" said editor\u00a0Christine L.

Panelists Nicole Maroulakos Goodwin, managing shareholder of the Phoenix office of Greenberg Traurig, and Leezie Kim, chief legal officer at Fox Restaurant Concepts, will discuss O\u2019Connor\u2019s legacy on the court and her influence in Arizona.O\u2019Connor was the first woman to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court after she was nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. She spent 25 years on the court, emerging as one of the more moderate justices of the time.O\u2019Connor was born in El Paso, Texas, and was raised on a cattle ranch near Duncan, Arizona. She graduated at the top of her class from Stanford Law School but focused on volunteer work and public service after law firms refused to interview her because she was a woman.\u00a0This led to her rise through the ranks of the Arizona Republican party from precinct captain to Arizona\u2019s assistant attorney general to the first female state Senate majority leader in the nation. O\u2019Connor was a state Court of Appeals judge when she was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by Reagan, who had made a campaign promise to name a woman to the highest bench. At the time of her appointment, she had never heard a federal case, but was well-regarded and well-connected within the Republican party.\u00a0Her hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee were the first of any Supreme Court nominee to be broadcast live on television, and tens of millions tuned in. O\u2019Connor\u2019s interrogators attempted, time and again over three days, to probe her about her views on the most controversial issues of the time. Her Senate confirmation was unanimous at 99 votes to 0, and she was officially sworn in on Sept. 25, 1981.During her tenure, O\u2019Connor was frequently viewed as a swing vote due to her moderate stance on various issues, as well as a judge who could negotiate with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. She served as the critical deciding vote on some of the most controversial issues of the 20th century, including those involving race, gender and reproductive rights. O\u2019Connor was the deciding vote in Bush v. Gore in 2000, which gave the presidential election to George W. Bush.O\u2019Connor retired from the U.S. Supreme Court in 2006. This PBS biography, released on the 40th anniversary of her appointment to the highest court, recounts the life of a pioneering woman who both reflected and shaped an era.To confirm your Arizona PBS membership and register for the virtual event, please contact Paulina Sanchez at\u00a0paulina.sanchez@asu.edu.]]>",

We are creators who make art and media and engaging products, but let\u2019s pay attention to the underlying assumptions that exist.\u201dTo help achieve the school\u2019s new goal, it has welcomed several new faculty, all with diverse, branching disciplines and backgrounds. These new faculty members will not only help arts, media and engineering students grow, but also assist in the growth of Arizona State University\u2019s new Mesa City Center project and programs.\"Among the School of Arts, Media and Engineering new faculty are several colleagues \u2014 Ana Herruzo, Laura Cechanowicz and Nicholas Pilarski \u2014 who will assist us for the ASU at Mesa City Center facility and its programs, which is an exciting beginning,\u201d said Jake Pinholster, associate dean of the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts. \u201cWe will be searching for a number of additional positions this year, and, by the time the building is complete in 2022, we will have put together a truly world-class team in extended reality (XR) technologies and related fields.\"Meet the new facultyDB Bauer, assistant professor of games and interactive media, School of Arts, Media and Engineering\u00a0Prior to pursuing graduate studies, DB Bauer worked for many years in television, radio and film production with New Mexico PBS, Koahnic Broadcast Corporation and other freelance outlets. Bauer has broad experience in both producing and production, with a primary focus on audio engineering. In addition to media production, Bauer has a background in digital media preservation for university archival collections.Bauer draws on this professional background in both previous and current research and teaching, focusing recently on the theoretical and social impact of new media theory and practice, speculative design, hands-on, critical making, and 3D media \u2014 particularly 3D media fabrication in both physical and virtual space.\u201cFor whatever reason, I can\u2019t help but be drawn to the beeping gadgets and neon lights that transport us to elsewheres and otherwises where things exist beyond, to quote Oscar Wilde, \u2018the sordid perils of actual existence,\u2019\u201d Bauer said. \u201cNot purely escapism \u2014 though certainly escapism surely has its benefits \u2014 digital tools allow us to bring those creative visions into everyday life and reimagine our shared futures.\u201dJoseph Watson, professor of practice, School of Arts, Media and Engineering and senior adviser to the dean, Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts\u00a0Joseph Watson, better known as Joe Watson, will work with arts, media and engineering in a number of ways, including mentoring students and sharing seminars, consulting with faculty on institutional and external strategy, and working with university leadership to elevate the work happening in the school. Watson has had a long career in strategy, business consulting, entrepreneurship and leadership development and has been featured in media outlets including The Today Show, CNN, PBS, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Fast Company and The Chronicle of Philanthropy. Watson has authored books such as \"Without Excuses: Unleash the Power of Diversity to Build Your Business\" and \"Where the Jobs Are Now.\"\u00a0He has been serving as senior adviser to the dean of the Herberger Institute and will continue in that role. He is also a member of The Fast Company Executive Board.\u00a0\u201cI am thrilled to be working with (the school) at the intersection of creativity and engineering \u2014 understanding its unique role in educating the next generation of robust critical thinkers,\" Watson said.Laura Cechanowicz, assistant professor, School of Arts, Media and Engineering and Graphic Information Technology programWith a jointly appointed contract with ASU's graphic information technology program and the School of Arts, Media and Engineering, Laura Cechanowicz will help the school with expanding research strengths in VR/AR/XR tech and its applications. Cechanowicz is an artist, designer and worldbuilder working in research, theory and practice across media, including extended reality and immersive technologies, VR/AR pre-visualization, animation, multimedia installation, narrative and experimental film, and production and sound design.Cechanowicz works across industry and academia, consulting, writing and conducting workshops and talks on the practice of worldbuilding. Their talks and workshops have been hosted at Disney, LASER, VRLA, in conferences and within communities around the world in the United States, Japan, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, India, Denmark and Brazil. Many of their worldbuilding projects have resulted in virtual reality immersive experiences presented at the Sundance Film Festival and in films, critically acclaimed interactive operas, multimedia collections displayed at the Venice Biennale, design frameworks for augmented reality apps and digital multimedia books. Cechanowicz\u2019s production design talent was recognized at the 2015 Berlinale.\u00a0Luke Kautz, clinical assistant professor of digital fabrication and 3D modeling, School of Arts, Media and EngineeringLuke Kautz is transitioning to faculty as a clinical assistant professor of digital fabrication and 3D modeling, having previously served as the digital design fabrication specialist running the school\u2019s FabLab. Kautz said he believes this direct experience and knowledge as staff support to students and faculty will lead to deeper connections between all involved, helping to lift the academic and research possibilities within the school, at ASU and beyond. His current explorations look at the illusory notion of regenerative design; the cross-pollination of disciplinary techniques for new practices; and the use of design technologies to create mutual generosity between ourselves and our natural and built environments.Kautz is also a senior researcher at the Center for Philosophical Technologies at ASU, having participated in several research and design projects.Before coming to ASU, Kautz worked as a junior designer in the architecture office of Frank Gehry in Los Angeles, and prior to that he was a lecturer in the Knowlton School of Architecture at Ohio State University.Nicholas Pilarski, associate professor, School of Arts, Media and Engineering and The Sidney Poitier New American Film School\u00a0Nicholas Pilarski is an award-winning filmmaker with a background in immersive media, music, film, theater and community work. He creates interactive and emerging media stories that attempt to address issues related to historicized poverty and class-based trauma. His art is not \u201cabout\u201d communities, but rather \u201cof\u201d them \u2014 helping build ecosystems where traditional lines between subject and author, teacher and student, and spectator and producer are intentionally contested and reimagined.Pilarski co-founded and co-directs Peoples Culture, an arts collective in Chicago and New York working to reimagine shared narratives through collaborative art-making practices, whose work has been archived in the permanent collection of The Smithsonian: National Museum of African American History and Culture. His work has appeared in The New York Times, the Museum of Modern Art, Eye Institute Netherlands, U.S. Departments of Interior and Education and the Chicago International Film Festival. Pilarski holds degrees from the University of Michigan and Duke University, and his research interests include XR and computational media, film and media theory, class, geographic conflict, dialectics, utopianism, phenomenology and cognitive neuroscience.\u00a0Ana Herruzo, associate professor, School of Arts, Media and Engineering and The Design SchoolAna Herruzo holds a master's degree in design research in media-art from SCI-arc, a bachelor's degree and master's degree in architecture from ETSAM (Madrid, Spain) and is currently finishing her PhD at ETSAM, as part of the architectural communication doctoral program. Her background is in architecture, experience design and real-time interactive media. Her main focus is on incorporating lighting, audio and video with physical environments, materials and human interaction.\u00a0Herruzo has served as chair of the Applied Computer Science Department at Woodbury and won multiple industry awards for her wide-ranging work in installation, live events, film, robotics and architecture. She hopes to help the school grow its strengths in experience design as part of the Mesa programs.\u00a0As a hobby, she said she enjoys creating experimental audiovisual performances and plays in an electronic music duo called IvanaBytes. She is also the co-founder of an art collective called NaiveLaser and an interactive agency, VIRTULABS.\u00a0]]>",

        "body": "Arizona State University alumnus Chris Gisriel, currently a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Chemistry at Yale University, was recently awarded a Pathway to Independence Award by the National Institutes of Health.These awards are given to postdoctoral scientists with promising careers to support independent research while receiving mentoring. The mentoring phase lasts for one to two years, followed by up to three years of independent research in professorship, for a total of up to five years of support. The goal of these awards is to facilitate the transition of postdoctoral scientists into independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty positions.Gisriel began his undergraduate studies in 2009 in ASU's School of Molecular Sciences. After earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013, he continued his studies in the school, earning his PhD in 2017 under Professor Kevin Redding. Following this, Gisriel was a postdoctoral fellow in Professor Petra Fromme\u2019s lab until 2019.\u201cChris started out in our group as an undergrad who really wasn\u2019t too sure about what he wanted to do with his life, but he fairly quickly matured into a serious researcher, \" Redding said. \"What I remember most strongly about Chris is his fearlessness \u2014 he took on some serious challenges, but never let the difficulties deter him. He just figured out what needed to be done, and then did whatever was necessary to solve the problem. One of the greatest joys of my career was watching him become the scientist he is today. This award is well deserved, and I have no doubt that he will continue to experience great success in his future career.\u201dHere, Gisriel reflects on this experience at ASU and the training he received in the School of Molecular Sciences.Question: How have your experiences at ASU in the School of Molecular Sciences and the Biodesign Institute prepared you for future success?Answer: The research faculty and culture at SMS and Biodesign shaped my personal identity as a researcher, which continues to aid in my endeavors today. Together, they have created an environment that leads my field of interest, photosynthesis research. My first glimpse into this community atmosphere was in SMS \u2014 at that time called the Department of Chemistry \u2014 as an undergraduate researcher in the Redding Lab. The lab member\u2019s passion for research was magnetizing. As I became aware of the broader scope of my research and the people who contributed the most in my field, it became clear that many of the biggest contributors were my colleagues, advisers and mentors at ASU.Q: What skills did you learn that you continue to utilize?A: As a person whose career goals entail maintaining well-funded academic research, an important aspect of my scientific upbringing was becoming familiar with the paths that others had taken to achieve success. I found abundant experience with this at SMS and Biodesign. During my graduate experience, I was given the opportunity to participate in writing scientific manuscripts and grant applications, I learned what career strategies would enhance my visibility in a competitive field, and I was immersed in my field of research by attending conferences with my lab members. All of these have been instrumental in my success today.Q: What do you find most memorable about your time at ASU?A: What stands out to me is that the community aspect of the research at ASU is very important. More than other universities in my experience so far, my research ideas and goals were encouraged, even at the lowest levels, by giants in my field of study. As long as I approached my goals with enthusiasm and dedication, my success was thoughtfully cultivated by SMS and Biodesign faculty. Namely, Kevin Redding, Petra Fromme, Neal Woodbury, Tom Moore and Bob Blankenship \u2014 although Bob did not come back to ASU until the end of my time there \u2014 have shaped how I act as a scientist. It is because of their mentorship and guidance, along with the examples they set, that I enjoy success today. I appreciate their investment in me, and I am already in the process of investing in students around me.]]>",

        "body": "The discovery of graphene \u2014 a single layer of graphite, also known as charcoal \u2014 revolutionized our understanding of low-dimensional materials and unraveled their potential for applications in quantum technologies.We now have a library of 2D materials with outstanding capabilities. Thanks to their weak chemical bonding, it is also possible to combine different types of 2D materials \u2014 like 2D Lego bricks \u2014 to engineer unique properties.One of the new editions to the catalog of properties available in 2D materials is magnetism: Utilizing and manipulating magnetism is crucial for quantum applications.A team of researchers from ASU shows in a recent manuscript published in Nano Letters, titled \"Moir\u00e9 Skyrmions and Chiral Magnetic Phases in Twisted CrX3 (X = I,Br, and Cl) Bilayers,\" that twisting two-dimensional magnets such as Cr-trihallides can lead to new magnetic phenomena such as skyrmions. Skyrmions are hedgehog-like arrays of magnetic moments with potential applications in memory devices.\u201cTwisting two-dimensional materials lead to large-scale structures called moir\u00e9 patterns. Moir\u00e9 patterns can significantly modify the properties of materials and give rise to new emergent phases,\u201d said Antia Botana, an assistant professor in the Department of Physics. \u201cSkyrmions have been sought after for a long time in 2D magnets. We are excited to show that Cr-based trihalides can be platform to realize them.\u201d\u201cEmploying complementary approaches is crucial to address complex phenomena in varying length scales,\u201d said Onur Erten, an assistant professor in the Department of Physics. \u201cIt would not be possible to conduct this project without the combined expertise of both groups.\u201dBotana and Erten emphasize the key role of the graduate students in this project.

        "title": "New research advances clean energy solutions",
        "body": "Meeting society\u2019s growing energy needs has become a daunting challenge for humanity. Demands for energy are expected to nearly double by the year 2050, while the effects of climate change, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, are already wreaking havoc in the form of droughts, wildfires, floods and other disasters.Gary Moore, a researcher at Arizona State University's\u00a0Biodesign Center for Applied Structural Discovery, thinks chemistry will play a vital role in the development of clean solutions to the world\u2019s mounting energy dilemma.In new research appearing on the cover of the journal\u00a0ChemElectroChem, Moore and his colleagues describe the use of ring-shaped molecules known as porphyrins. Such molecules, among the most abundant pigments in nature, are noted for their ability to speed up or catalyze chemical reactions, including important reactions occurring in living systems.Among these reactions is the conversion of radiant energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in molecular bonds, a process exploited by plants and photosynthetic microbes. This chemical energy can then be used to fuel the organism\u2019s metabolism, through the process of cellular respiration.Researchers like Moore hope to take a page from nature\u2019s playbook, creating synthetic analogs to natural processes of photosynthesis. The new study describes a synthetic diiron-containing porphyrin and explores its potential as an effective catalyst.Gary Moore is is a researcher at the Biodesign Center for Applied Structural Discovery. Photo by Biodesign Institute\u201cRather than exploiting the products of natural photosynthesis, we can be inspired by our knowledge of photosynthesis to pioneer new materials and technologies with properties and capabilities rivalling those of their biological counterparts,\u201d Moore said.Porphyrins, and their structurally related analogs, are found in abundance across the biological world. They act to bind a range of metal ions to perform far-flung cellular tasks. Chlorophyll molecules, for example, bind magnesium (a crucial chemical stage in plant photosynthesis), while heme \u2013 an iron-containing porphyrin \u2014 helps organize molecular oxygen and carbon-dioxide transport and provides the necessary electron-transport chains essential for cellular respiration. Because of their commanding role in life processes, porphyrin abnormalities are responsible for a range of serious diseases.Porphyrins can also be used as catalysts in synthetic devices known as electrochemical cells, which convert chemical energy into electrical energy, or vice versa. Although radiant energy from the sun may be stored within conventional types of batteries, such applications are limited by their low-energy densities compared with fuels used for modern transportation.Moore\u2019s efforts to design artificial photosynthetic systems could provide a valuable piece of the renewable energy puzzle, producing \u201cnon-fossil-based\u201d fuels as well as a range of beneficial commodities.Such devices would allow the capture and storage of solar energy for use when and where it is needed and can be constructed using chemicals that are far cheaper and more abundant than the materials currently in use for conventional solar energy applications.The paper has been selected for the cover of the current issue of the journal, with a descriptive graphic produced by\u00a0Jason Drees, multimedia developer lead at ASU, and is part of a special collection dedicated to Professor Jean-Michel Sav\u00e9ant.]]>",

        "body": "Derrick Beetso, a 2010 alumnus of the Sandra Day O\u2019Connor College of Law at Arizona State University, has been named to take the helm of the college\u2019s Indian gaming and tribal self-governance programs.Beetso, a citizen of the Navajo Nation, earned his JD and certificate in Indian law as part of ASU Law\u2019s nationally recognized Indian Legal Program. As director of the Indian gaming and tribal self-governance programs, he builds on the earlier leadership and work of ASU Law professors Lawrence Roberts and Ann Marie Bledsoe Downes, who helped launch the programs in 2019. Both recently went on leave from the college to serve in President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.Prior to joining ASU Law, Beetso served as the general counsel for the National Congress of American Indians, the first and only Native person to ever serve in this capacity for the organization. While there, he handled in-house legal needs and co-managed the Tribal Supreme Court Project with the Native American Rights Fund.Beetso also served as an attorney-adviser within the Office of the Solicitor\u2019s Phoenix Field Office, where he provided legal services for the Western Region of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the San Carlos Irrigation Project. Previously, he served as counselor to Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs Kevin Washburn during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.With his experience in Washington, D.C., and ASU Law\u2019s growing presence there, Beetso will help to expand educational and career opportunities for Indian Legal Program students in the nation\u2019s capital.He will teach one of the program\u2019s popular traveling classes this fall, allowing ASU Law students to study on the Washington, D.C., campus. The class, Federal Advocacy for the Tribal Client, is a unique experience that introduces students to decisionmakers and facilitates networking with future employers, while providing students time to explore opportunities in the city.\u201cWe are excited to welcome one of our distinguished alums back to campus,\u201d said Patty Ferguson Bohnee, faculty director for the Indian Legal Program and director of the Indian Legal Clinic. \u201cDerrick Beetso has a deep understanding of Indian Affairs and has committed his career to advancing the rights of tribal nations. His experience working for tribes and the government, as well as his success in developing effective partnerships make him a perfect fit for our ILP team.\u201dBeetso said he is honored to return to ASU Law as faculty.\u201cThe great work the ILP has done since its inception at ASU Law has furthered the life goals of so many talented Native and non-Native professionals and has helped ensure tribal nations receive excellent representation in the legal field,\u201d he said. \u201cI am humbled to be able to share my experience, and I look forward to contributing to the ILP\u2019s mission as best I can.\u201dThe first of their kind in the nation, the\u00a0Indian gaming and tribal self-governance programs\u00a0were established thanks to an initial contribution generously given by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians to further ASU Law\u2019s commitment to serving the educational needs of tribal nations. With the Indian gaming emphasis, ASU Law is providing in-depth courses for students on the regulation, compliance and implementation of Indian gaming. ASU Law\u2019s\u00a0Master of Legal Studies\u00a0(MLS) degree will equip professionals with the essential legal components of Indian gaming to excel in careers that intersect with Indian gaming.Similarly, the self-governance emphasis is designed to educate students, whether they desire to work for tribes, the federal government or states, in really understanding the legal framework of the tribal-federal relationship, the federal programs and statutes that promote tribal self-governance and the implementation of that legal framework.The support from the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians will help increase educational opportunities in the field of Indian law and the expansion of work experiences for students interested in Indian law, and it will continue to contribute to the development of Indian law trainings for Indian tribes and organizations.

Fulton Schools of Engineering\u00a0at Arizona State University. \u201cThe technology is mature and reliable. Plus, it\u2019s highly cost effective. Actually, wind is market competitive even without financial incentives. So, there are good reasons for its further development.\u201dAccording to the\u00a0U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable energy sources now represent 20% of the electricity generated in America. Within that sector, wind is the most significant source (8.4%), followed by hydropower (7.3%) and solar (2.3%). Additionally, wind energy continues to grow more substantially than any other renewable. Its share of that category is expected to exceed 10% this year as new facilities enter operation.\u201cWhen we talk about new wind energy sites, the Great Plains are considered the richest resource area in the United States,\u201d said Calhoun, who is director of the\u00a0Environmental Remote Sensing Group, which operates within the\u00a0School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy, one of the seven Fulton Schools. His team conducts atmospheric research and technology development to advance wind energy industry systems.\u201cThe region is ideal in that it has excellent wind and also is not very populated,\u201d he said. \u201cBut whatever you build in those remote spaces needs to be connected to the grid. And that route to market is a big issue.\u201dHigh-voltage lines cross cities, counties and states, and there is no single federal authority to secure the necessary permissions to build new ones. Additionally, they cost a lot of money. To address these hurdles, the infrastructure framework now before Congress includes establishment of a new Grid Development Authority to finance and facilitate new transmission lines.Laying this literal groundwork is crucial to building new wind energy sites. But it\u2019s also important for expanding the number of commercial solar energy facilities, since solar farms operate in similarly isolated regions. For example, the Agua Caliente Solar Project outside Yuma, Arizona, and the Solana Generating Station near Gila Bend, Arizona, cover more than 4,000 acres in the open desert.\u201cInvesting in the physical grid is probably one of the most important things we can do to support burgeoning renewable energy fields such as wind and solar,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cThe other challenge is figuring out the intermittency issue. How do we tackle the times when the wind doesn\u2019t blow and the sun doesn\u2019t shine?\u201dGigawatts through a pipeMuch attention has turned to advancing battery technology as a means to balance out the fluctuating nature of power generated by wind and solar sites. But many experts say batteries are too expensive to encourage more commercial-scale renewable energy generation.\u201cBatteries are great for short cycles of loading and unloading. They can work for storing grid energy from morning to evening. But their capital cost is too large to sit on electricity for six months,\u201d says\u00a0Klaus Lackner, a professor of environmental engineering in the\u00a0School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, also one of the Fulton Schools at ASU.By contrast, Lackner says the cost of storing and moving energy in liquid form is negligible. Think of all the energy on tap at gas stations across the country. Also consider that a single gallon of gasoline represents the daily kilowatt usage of a typical American household.\u201cThe power we can run through pipelines dwarfs what we can get through transmission lines,\u201d Lackner said. \u201cWe can move gigawatts through a single pipe.\u201dBut how do we practically transform energy generated by wind and solar farms into liquid fuel? The answer could be the technology of capturing carbon from the air.Lackner is director of the\u00a0Center for Negative Carbon Emissions, which researches technology to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to both combat the adverse effects of climate change and help advance sustainable energy infrastructure.Central to their work is the development of a \u201cmechanical tree\u201d system that harvests CO2\u00a0from the air. While still at prototype stage, application of the new technology includes concentrating the carbon dioxide for commercial use in carbonating beverages, filling fire extinguishers and making dry ice.\u201cWe also can combine that CO2\u00a0with hydrogen produced through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy like solar. And through that combination, we can create gasoline or diesel or jet fuel,\u201d Lackner said. \u201cThe necessary technology already exists, but it needs to get cheaper through a little more innovation and expanding scale. My prediction is that it will happen in the next five years.\u201dFuel literally created from the air could offer the storage medium needed to solve the intermittency issue impeding greater adoption of wind and solar energy generation technology. It could also attenuate fossil fuel extraction and processing for transportation. If carbon from the atmosphere can power our planes, trains and automobiles, there may be no need to drill into the earth for more petroleum.This innovation seems like a pivotal opportunity to arrest the greenhouse gas accumulation driving climate change; and carbon capture is explicitly listed as a new technology priority in the infrastructure framework before Congress.But Lackner and colleagues at the Fulton Schools point out that averting greater ecological adversity requires more than recycling atmospheric carbon. Additional volumes need to be prevented entirely, and that likely means electrifying transportation.Gorilla in the roomAccording to the\u00a0U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions in America come from electricity generation. But transportation accounts for an even larger share of the problem: 29%.To reduce those gases, the bipartisan bill in Congress also dedicates nearly $6 billion to replace aging public transit system buses with zero-emission vehicles. Additionally, $7.5 billion is earmarked to start a national network of vehicle-charging stations to accelerate the adoption of electric cars.\u201cIt\u2019s a logical step if we really want to cut emissions,\u201d said\u00a0Vijay Vittal, a Regents Professor of electrical engineering in the\u00a0School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, also one of the Fulton Schools. \u201cBut if everybody buys an electric car, the added loads on our distribution grid suddenly become very large. How are we going to support those additions? This question is sort of an 800-pound gorilla in the room.\u201dVittal explains that the padmount transformers used in most residential neighborhoods are typically designed to supply four or five households. There are millions of these units across the country, but they were designed and deployed at a time when demand for energy was lower. So, if droves of people start driving electric vehicles, our current power distribution systems won\u2019t be able to handle charging them all after work each day.Consequently, there is an acute need for urban and suburban grid modernization to support consumers and commerce; and it parallels the need for added high-voltage transmission infrastructure to support wind and solar farms in remote corners of America. Both are long-overdue investments in the capacity and resilience of a system that is vital to the operation of society.\u201cFortunately, this is not a technology issue,\u201d said Vittal, who is a former director of the National Science Foundation\u2019s\u00a0Power Systems Engineering Research Center, a consortium of universities and industry focused on the future of electrical energy infrastructure. \u201cAt a local level, our utilities just need to pull out those old transformers put in new ones. Of course, there is significant cost to work at this scale. But the cost of not doing it may be even greater.\u201dTop photo:\u00a0Renewable energy generation technologies are capable of supplying a greater share of national power demand. But making that happen requires investment in fundamental transmission and distribution elements of the electricity grid. Image courtesy of Shutterstock]]>",

        "body": "This semester, five new faculty members are joining the College of Global Futures.Their unique and diverse backgrounds in sustainability, technology, innovation, education and policy will contribute to the college's vision of creating a sustainable, equitable and vibrant future for everyone on a thriving, healthy planet.Learn more about the new faculty members.Eusebio ScornavaccaProfessor in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society in the College of Global Futures, and the Thunderbird School of Global ManagementTo say that\u00a0Eusebio Scornavacca\u00a0has a diverse background is almost an understatement. He speaks seven languages, has been a visiting professor in 10 different countries and has a strong research collaboration network across six continents. He has a deep and diverse cultural appreciation that allows him to understand and collaborate with people all around the world.Scornavacca joins ASU from the University of Baltimore, where he was the Parsons Professor of Digital Innovation and director of the Center for Digital Communication, Commerce and Culture. His research focuses on the intersection of disruptive digital innovation with socioeconomic and environmental impact.\"I look at the development of digital innovation and how it can produce a smart, equitable and sustainable future,\" Scornavacca said. \"How can we use digital technologies to help reduce our carbon footprint or create more inclusive financial systems? How can we leverage the capabilities of the digital ecosystem to foster entrepreneurship that creates positive socio-economic and environmental outcomes?\"Scornavacca believes that while digital innovations are disruptive and pose risks, it also has immense potential to do some good.\"Technological development and technological innovation need to be looked at with a balance between the positive and negative impacts and always in light of the context that is being used,\" Scornavacca said. \"How can technology, instead of furthering inequalities, actually help to create a better world for everyone?\"Beza MeridAssistant professor in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society\u00a0in the College of Global FuturesWhen discussing illness and disease, stand-up comedy isn't the traditional venue. But the contradiction between comedy and tragedy can actually lead to some intimate conversations. The unlikely pair has become one of the topics of\u00a0Beza Merid's research. He studies people's experiences of illness and disease, and the types of social and cultural elements that can shape those experiences. He has found that stand-up comedy can enable people to have more difficult and often taboo conversations, and even creates a shared experience.\"Stand-up comedy operates as a place where people have conversations that bend the rules of society,\" Merid said. \"It enables us to explore and confront these difficult topics and not think of them as isolated, personalized experiences that we have to deal with on our own. Stand-up comedy can create a collective understanding that shows we're all struggling with these kinds of things. It's something we can all relate to.\"Merid joins ASU from the University of Michigan Medical School, where he also studied the technologies and innovation surrounding health and illness. Part of his research looked at whether mobile apps could be used to encourage people with high blood pressure to eat healthier and exercise more. But not everyone has access to the same resources to make the technology most effective. The technology only works if everyone has access to the same resources.\"We can design technologies, but we can't really innovate our way out of these structural problems,\" Merid said. \"One of the important things for us to do when we're thinking about the relationship between health and technology innovation is to think about the broader political and social systems that create these problems to begin with. By bringing all those things together, we have a better shot of collectivizing our solutions.\"Janna Goebel\u00a0Assistant professor in the School of Sustainability\u00a0in the College of Global FuturesJanna Goebel\u00a0is no stranger to ASU. She recently completed her PhD in educational policy and evaluation at the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College. But her focus on sustainability is relatively new. While earning her PhD, she learned more about the sustainability work happening at ASU and started engaging with the researchers behind it. That urge to study sustainability and our interconnectedness with nature took her to Brazil for her dissertation. She studied how education can be conceptualized beyond the current approach that puts humans at the center of everything.\"I'm interested in how we can reconfigure our relationships with the Earth,\" Goebel said. \"I study how education can influence and change our perceptions so that we can see beyond our view of human exceptionalism.\"Sustainability education is more than just incorporating Sustainable Development Goals into the curriculum. Goebel's research also looks at environmental justice and how education is part of the problem and solution to the sustainability challenges we're facing.\"The power dynamics of the world create sustainability problems,\" Goebel said. \"We know that the people who suffer most from climate change do not contribute most to its causes. We have to look at how education is part of that system of oppression, but also liberation. We have to see how sustainability education can be incorporated across all different discipline areas so that we can start to chip away at some of these very persistent status quo power dynamics that are causing some to suffer much more than others.\"Ding FeiClinical assistant professor in the School of Sustainability\u00a0in the College of Global FuturesA conversation with road builders in western China helped shape\u00a0Ding Fei's research. While doing international fieldwork for her master's degree in geography, she spoke with a team of workers and learned they were headed to East Africa for their next project. She wanted to learn more about China's global presence and why these construction workers would travel to another country to work, so she followed them to East Africa to observe their operations.\"There is a big debate about China,\" Fei said. \"Some people say China is a distinctive development partner; they have good foreign policies, are very generous in providing loans and investment, and will contribute to sustainable development in Africa. But others say China is a neocolonial power and is using elite diplomacy or resource diplomacy to perpetuate African underdevelopment.\"While conducting her research in East Africa, Fei felt that China did not give a very clear picture of what it was doing overseas or how its activities influenced development in other countries. She wants to bring a more critical analysis of China's overseas activities to better understand the nation's impact and the implications of sustainable development in the Global South.\"When we talk about China or any emerging power, we often use very nationalistic terms to address it as a whole, coherent actor while operating abroad,\" Fei said. \"But in fact, there are so many institutions and actors from China, and they have different layers of interactions with the African host country. When they interact, many contingencies or complexities emerge. Also, the host country is not just a passive recipient of aid or investment. It is also trying to carve its developmental path, but its ability to do so is often limited by its own history, domestic political conditions, social conditions and government capabilities. We need to both recognize the agency or the strategies of the host countries, but also critically analyze their constraints to inform policymaking in the future.\"Danae Hernandez-Cortes\u00a0Assistant professor in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society and the School of Sustainability, both\u00a0in the College of Global FuturesDanae Hernandez-Cortes\u00a0wanted to help vulnerable communities and felt one way to do that was through the lens of economics. But when she arrived in Mexico City to earn her bachelor's degree in economics, she noticed another problem that needed solving: pollution. And she believed that environmental policies were one of the contributors.\"When I was starting my undergrad, I wanted to understand what parts of environmental policy were affecting pollution and how we can solve them,\" Hernandez-Cortes said. \"I then decided to do my PhD in economics to try to get more knowledge on how these different policies could affect pollution exposure.\"Hernandez-Cortes' research took an interdisciplinary approach with an emphasis on equity; she focused on the sources of environmental inequality and the distributional consequences of environmental policy. She found that her background in economics was instrumental in her research.\"Economics is all about scarcity and trade-offs,\" Hernandez-Cortes said. \"Recognizing that scarcity, and that the policy implications we are trying to achieve have trade-offs, is the main basis for environmental policy. There's nothing more scarce than natural resources, and trying to solve different environmental problems will always involve trade-offs. By looking at these, we're able to understand better policies that could help design efficient and equitable environmental policy.\"]]>",

        "title": "Adding a minor can enhance what a student learns in a major",
        "body": "Majors are among the stars of the academic world. Whether students keep the same one throughout their time in college, change them along the way or double them up, majors play a central role in the college experience.Rarer, though, are mentions of a minor or an academic certificate gained through completing specially arranged courses. That\u2019s often because students don\u2019t have a minor or in many cases may not even know they exist.Faculty members in Arizona State University's\u00a0Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions say minors deepen students\u2019 academic experiences and offer complementary knowledge to what they are getting from their majors that can make a difference as they enter careers \u2014 and adding a minor often costs no additional tuition.The college offers 13 minors, nine of which are within the School of Community Resources and Development. Those nine minors range from special event management to recreation therapy to community sports management.Watts College enrollment estimates for this semester report that about 604 ASU students have minors based at the college out of more than 9,800 throughout the university.In addition, the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice offers a minor in criminology and criminal justice, the School of Social Work offers one in social welfare, and the School of Public Affairs offers one each in public service and public policy, and in urban and metropolitan studies.The college also offers 14 certificate programs for completing certain menus of courses. Find them, as well as the college\u2019s minors, on\u00a0this list of all ASU academic minors and certificates.Minors can refine broader themes in majorsMinors and certificate programs offer students ways to enhance learning from courses in their majors, say two\u00a0School of Community Resources and Development faculty members, who work with several students with minors.A student\u2019s experience in a more broadly defined major can benefit from a minor, said Lecturer Claire McWilliams, who teaches tourism development management.\u201cI see minors as smart extensions that broaden the reach of a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d McWilliams said. \u201cYou could have a dozen students graduate with a communications degree, but only a few of them will have an events certificate and a minor in tourism.\u201dIncluding minors and certificates on a resume can make students stand out to potential employers, McWilliams said.\u00a0\u201cI see them as a very practical thing.\u201dErin Schneiderman, a clinical assistant professor who teaches special events management, agreed based on evidence she has observed among students who take that subject as a minor.\u201cWhen they take it as a minor, it means they want to go deeper into the events industry. They believe that the additional credential will enhance their major,\u201d Schneiderman said. \u201cFor example, a (criminology and criminal justice) major will say, \u2018I\u2019m interested in special events management, and if I\u2019m working in law enforcement and assigned to a specific event, I\u2019ll want to know what\u2019s happening around me.\u2019\u201dSchneiderman said other examples include fashion majors learning about how fashion shows are created, or art students who know they will show their work in public art festivals, both of which are discussed in special events management classes.Some students don\u2019t know minors are availableThe often-large undertaking of choosing a major sometimes leaves some students forgetting or even unaware they can pick a minor or certificate program as well, McWilliams said.\u201cThere\u2019s a big challenge for them to sort out majors. We\u2019re trying to get them to be aware of minors and certificates in the larger picture in putting together their college program,\u201d McWilliams said.A more diverse menu of items on a student\u2019s academic transcript show that student has had a more well-rounded experience, McWilliams said.In addition to complementing a student\u2019s major, a minor also can afford the chance to explore a second discipline that interests them, said Joanna Lucio, Watts College associate dean for academic affairs.\u201cFor instance, minoring in a language, such as Spanish, can help a nonprofit major who wants to work for a nonprofit that serves a Spanish-speaking population,\u201d Lucio said. \u201cOr, a criminal justice or public service and public policy major might minor in social welfare if they want to focus their careers in social services.\u201dStudents gain additional knowledge that will help them on a career path, broaden their perspective and add depth in an area of their interest \u2014 and it is reflected on their academic transcript, she said.Students praise adding minors to their experienceAlexandra Monksfield, a junior supply chain management and business (public policy) major, said she uses knowledge from her special events management minor every day.\u201cEvents management is very similar to project management,\u201d Monksfield said. \u201cI use the key ideas and tools I have learned to put them in a business aspect and give me the upper hand to finding more creative ways to solve issues. Not only does my minor allow me to interact with people not in the\u00a0business program, but I am also given more opportunities across the job market.\u201dSamantha Sahagun, a junior social work major, recently added a minor in parks and protected area management that she said will provide her more resources for day-to-day living.\u201cI have always been very passionate and fascinated\u00a0with being outdoors and wanting to better the environment. I thought the perfect way to accomplish this was by furthering my knowledge by adding a minor in something that I am\u00a0passionate about and can hopefully use in my social work career,\u201d Sahagun said.Caitlin Personale, a senior marketing major, said her special events management minor has opened up several new doors, introducing her to \u201ccountless people, companies and roles never before thought of.\u201d\u201cI was able to identify key strengths of mine and strong passions within the classes that I was previously unaware of,\u201d Personale said. \u201cFrom nonprofit leadership to sports tourism, both the transferable skills and real-world application value are unbeatable.\u201d\u00a0Lucio said that while students can have more than one minor, she strongly recommends students consult with their academic advisers before enrolling. Interested students can find information about minors and certificate programs from this list.\u00a0\u00a0]]>",

        "title": "Buggin' around in southern Arizona",
        "body": "Editor's note: Arizona State University photographer and videographer Deanna Dent recently joined researchers from the\u00a0Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center\u00a0on a trip to southern Arizona, where they collected insects after a strong monsoon. Here's what she learned.This year may well be one of\u00a0southern\u00a0Arizona\u2019s wettest monsoons in recorded history, and that has translated into vibrant plant growth and an increase in insect and animal populations after years of extreme drought.The photo above shows a large pond in the grasslands near the U.S.-Mexico border, east of Nogales, Arizona, and is exactly what researchers from BioKIC, or the Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center, wanted to see. The researchers planned out a monsoon collection trip this past weekend, and while it's open to researchers, students and their families, they were kind enough to invite me with them as well. As an Arizona native it felt like a rare chance to go onto our public lands and learn about the plants, insects and animals of southern Arizona.When I first arrived at the Coronado National Forest campsite on Friday night, white sheets were being set up, glowing brightly in the darkness. These white sheets are clamped to a metal frame with a mercury vapor light at top, and a black light resting in the middle of the sheet. The lights were connected to a generator and run until midnight, attracting all types of insects from the dark. Between dinner and breaks, chatting folks examined the sheets to see what had been attracted, commenting at the variety and beauty of the insects. Researchers opted between cupping the small insects in their hands and placing them in vials or jars, or using the aspirator, a kind of vaccuum that pulls in small insects with a filter protecting the operators. These methods work well, but what struck me as interesting was that experts don't know why insects are attracted to the lights. They have theories, but no one knows why they're drawn to bright lights.The students, researchers and community members all spend time together, creating a strong sense of community interest. I'm perfectly welcome to ask a series of silly questions to experts in their field about how many insect species exist in the world or why they collect this beetle but not that one. Or why are moths dusty? And thankfully there are no unwelcome questions.I ask, \"Why this particular area of the Patagonia mountains?\"\"This kind of highlands region, and to the Santa Rita mountains north of us, really contained a lot of interesting records from jaguars to a lot of reptiles and amphibians that just get into the U.S. from Mexico and extend their range into here,\" said Andrew Johnston,\u00a0invertebrates collections manager and darkling beetle researcher. \"So there were a lot of potentially interesting things for us to find in the less documented mountain range.\"As the night continues, we find the Arizona state reptile, an Arizona ridge-nosed rattlesnake, curled at the base of a tree just a few feet from one campsite. We walk the small creek looking for frogs and toads, which you can hear but not really see. One camper shares the cicada they found preparing to molt, while botanist Elizabeth Makings shares a desert stink beetle and a dragonfly rests on the white sheet.I also learned that although experts are very familiar with all the mammal species on Earth, there's a huge question mark on insect species.\u00a0\"It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ve not described even half of the diversity of insects that currently exist and alive in the world today,\"\u00a0Johnston said.A lack of knowledge of the insect life in an area adds to a lack of future understanding about our environment and ecological systems, as climate change affects our state over time.\u00a0The generators go out at midnight and folks head to tents for the evening. As the sun rises over the mountains, green stretches all across the mountains and grasslands below, a shocking green that almost seems out of place in Arizona nowadays.In the morning, Makings and researcher Ed Gilbert head up a stream\u00a0that runs through the campsite with three ASU undergraduate students \u2014 Ethan Wright, Marcus Reid and Mary Haddad. Makings spends time walking with the students as they explore the grasses, plants, insects and the environment.\"I love to do fieldwork; I mean, why wouldn't you get buggy and hot and sweaty,\" said Makings, who helps organize the trips. \"It's all about the camaraderie and, you know, interacting with scientists that are ... amazing in their field, and I just enjoy learning from everybody.\"Gilbert's son, Aven Klecker, manages to catch a fencepost lizard with his lizard lasso. While holding the lizard in his hand, he flips it upside down and gently rubs its belly, which puts it into a still state. He shows the trick to Haddad, who holds the lizard until he jumps up and runs aways.As we concluded our walk, another set of researchers jumped in four-wheel-drive vehicles to explore the mountaintop areas reachable only by some rough forest roads. As we drive through some of the most scenic areas, we look for areas of interest and finally stop at a high point with a depression that has filled with water, creating a kind of pond in the center.Researchers head out into the water with their nets to catch dragonflies or photograph botanical species. With every interesting find, everyone rushes over to take a look before the insects are released. School of Sustainability researcher Rick Overson spends time photographing the different insects with his 100mm macro lens, and environmental and\u00a0zoological collections manager Laura Steger uses her net to collect dragonflies before we finally head back to camp. After a quick lunch, another group of researchers heads down to the nearly chest-height grassland areas near the U.S.-Mexico border.\u00a0Just near Lochiel, Arizona, we pull off on a road and head to a grassy area, after being rained out of the road to Scotia Canyon in the Huachuca Mountains. We can see the monsoon storm clouds all around but somehow don't receive a hint of rain. The grasses give way to a small pond where we find a frog and a western patch-nosed snake, which apparently is a county over from where it is described as having range;\u00a0this is noted. We patch a punctured tire and someone passes around Trader Joe's cookies as we decide to head up to reach the campsite before dark. Folks are trying to bet whether the rains hit our campsite and if their sleeping bags will be soaked.\u00a0We reach the camp to find that it has not only rained but hailed, and while those who stayed behind tried their best to protect the area, everything is wet and damp. Unfortunately this means most insects won't come out to the white sheet at all, so we sit down and eat a spaghetti dinner together. Folks share photos from the day's finds. We hear jokes and stories about past trips and almost impassible roads, along with a limerick or two before everyone heads to bed.The next morning everyone sits down for breakfast and a final touch-base as the camp breaks down. I interview\u00a0Johnston and Makings and record sound of the stream, which is running with water this morning, and plan out my route back home through Patagonia to Tucson and back to Phoenix.\u00a0Makings is leaving with over 150 grass specimens \u2014 a wealth of samples after years of drought, which may take weeks to process back at the Alameda Center.Johnston\u00a0shows me the tools of the trade, including forceps, an aspirator, nets and archival vials \u2014 though takeout containers can work temporarily as well. He says sometimes he saves samples in his freezer until he's ready to process, and it makes me wonder if that ever surprises anyone.\u00a0It's a bright beautiful morning as we all head back to regular life, and I'm glad I spent this weekend out in the wilderness with such an amazing group of experts.\u00a0]]>",

        "title": "ASU professor researching how humans can help technology detect bad bots",
        "body": "An Arizona State University professor is researching how to track malevolent social media bots by using a human touch.Victor Benjamin, who researches artificial intelligence, is looking at how people\u2019s reactions to social media posts can be mined for clues on content that may be generated by automated accounts called bots.\u201cMy co-author and I had this hunch that as bots are becoming more prolific on the internet, users are becoming more able to detect when something looks fishy,\u201d said Benjamin, an assistant professor in the Information Systems Department in the W. P. Carey School of Business at ASU.\u201cCould we apply bot-detection technology and augment that by relying on human intelligence in the crowd responses?\u201dBenjamin's most recent paper on detecting malicious bots was published in PeerJ Computer Science, an open-access journal. He worked with Raghu Santanam, who holds the McCord Chair of Business in the Information Systems Department, and that research looked at how how the same fake news translated across various regional dialects may be detected using advanced linguistic models.Bots are dangerous because they spread misinformation and conspiracy theories.\"This vaccine misinformation is scary stuff,\" he said, so finding a faster and better way of detecting bots is more important. That's why Benjamin decided to look at whether adding humans to the computer algorithms was more accurate.He used the platform Reddit because it has posts and replies that lend themselves to looking at crowd reactions. The researchers wanted to weigh the level of certainty over people\u2019s bot detection.\u201cYou could have two users and one might say, \u2018I think this is a bot\u2019 and the other might say, \u2018I know for sure this is a bot.\u2019\u201cThat\u2019s the angle of our research \u2014 how to signal different certainties. You don\u2019t want to blindly trust every crowd response.\u201dOne factor that can hamper research is the lack of public data sets from social media platforms. Reddit is maintained by volunteer moderators who share lists among themselves of which accounts might be bots. The researchers collected those lists, then analyzed the crowd responses to posts from those accounts.They applied \u201cspeech action theory,\u201d a linguistic theory, to determine the level of certainty that someone found a bot.\u201cIt\u2019s a way to quantify the intended or underlying meaning of spoken utterances,\u201d Benjamin said.In the replies, the researchers looked at whether \u201cbot\u201d was mentioned, which was a strong indicator of accuracy in finding a bot. Sentiment, such as a strong negative reaction to the topic of bots, was a less important indicator.The research, which is currently under review, found that analyzing the human reactions added to the accuracy of the computational bot-detection system.It\u2019s important to root out bots because they are a major source of misinformation spread on social media. Bots controlled by Russian trolls are a major driver of the lies that the 2020 election was stolen, researchers say. Last spring, Benjamin authored an op-ed column in the Boston Globe about how social media platforms need to step up the fight against misinformation.\u201c(Bots) hijack conversations on controversial issues to derail or inflame the discussion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor example, bots have posed as Black Lives Matter activists and shared divisive posts designed to stoke racial tensions. When real people try to make their voices heard online, they do so within a landscape that\u2019s increasingly poisoned and polarized by bots.\u201dNever before in human history have foreign governments been so successful in being able to target the populace of another country.\u00a0\u2014 ASU Assistant Professor Victor BenjaminOne way social media platforms can help curb bots is by releasing more data to their users, who could then decide whether a post is from a bot.\u201cWe\u2019re relying on public, open-source data \u2014 whatever the platforms make available to us.\u00a0But the platforms have a lot of data they never reveal, such as how often users log in or how many hours their activity level remains continuous. A bot might have a 16-hour session,\u201d he said.\u201cIf you see someone posting very inflammatory messages, why can\u2019t the platform reveal that data? \u2018This user posts 300 messages a day, and they\u2019re all inflammatory about America.\u2019\u201cOr if there\u2019s a hashtag that suddenly becomes popular on Twitter, Twitter has the metadata to show how that hashtag was formed. Was it organic growth or did it appear millions of times out of nowhere within a few minutes?\u201dNo private data would need to be revealed.\u201cWe just need metadata on usage of a hashtag or origin of country of where a hashtag is most frequently tweeted from.\u201cIf it\u2019s a Black Lives Matter tagline being tweeted from Russia, we should be suspicious.\u201dThe problem is that it\u2019s not in the social media platforms\u2019 best interest to do anything that would decrease engagement, he said.\u201cThe more a user engages, whether it\u2019s a bot or not, the more it helps the value of the platform.\u201cIf they say, \u201830 percent of users are bots,\u2019 what does that do to the value of the platform?\u201dScrutiny of social media platforms heightened during the divisive 2016 election.\u201cWith Facebook, I\u2019ll give them credit. They released data saying, \u2018We noticed a lot of advertising paid for by Russian state agencies,\u2019 \u201d Benjamin said.\u201cAnd Twitter put out a small grant for improving the conversational health of social media. They acknowledged some of their responsibility for maintaining the quality of online conversations, but they\u2019re still not at the level we want them to be of releasing the metadata.\u201dBenjamin called the current state of affairs \u201can arms race\u201d between bot authors and bot detection.\u201cSocial media bots out in the wild today are always listening for new instructions from their owners. They can change their behavior in real time.\u201cIf you have a static detection method, invariably the bots will learn to evade it.\u201dThat\u2019s why a system incorporating humans could be faster and more accurate. But the system would have to be adaptable, learning linguistic patterns from different languages.The next frontier for bots \u2014 and using human detection \u2014 will be video.\u201cIf you go on YouTube, there are now algorithmically generated videos that are completely generated by bots. It\u2019s a lot of the same stuff \u2014 to spread misinformation and random conspiracies and so on,\u201d he said.The bots are creating narrative videos with unique content and music.\u201cSome are of low quality, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell whether they are bot-generated or by someone who is new to creating videos,\u201d he said.One way to catch bot-generated videos is through applying the \u201ctheory of mind,\u201d or the ability to consider how another person would see something \u2014 a perspective that is difficult for bot-generated content. For example, a human would align the visual and audio content in a video, but a bot might not.\u201cWhere would a human content creator apply theory of mind that a bot might not, and how can we see those discrepancies?\u201d\u00a0Benjamin asked.He said that vaccine misinformation amplified by bots is especially scary.\u201cNever before in human history have foreign governments been so successful in being able to target the populace of another country,\u201d he said.Top image courtesy of Pixabay.com]]>",

        "title": "Downtown Phoenix campus turns 15",
        "body": "It was once a place where people cleared out after work, where most restaurants closed by 3 p.m., where only the occasional sports game or First Fridays art walk drew a younger crowd.Now Arizona State University students live and learn on the Downtown Phoenix campus, bringing an energy and presence that have helped inject new life into the area.It\u2019s easy to forget that the Downtown Phoenix campus\u2019 vibrant collection of new and renovated buildings, residence halls, entrepreneurship spaces and streetscapes were once vacant acreage, parking lots and neglected commercial space. Now it\u2019s a place where students study health and nursing, journalism, public service and law; gather in open spaces for social events; and do outreach with various local communities.The campus marks its 15th anniversary this school year.\u201cThe ASU Downtown Phoenix campus represents the best of what is possible when a city joins forces with an innovative university to address a community need and reimagine all the ways they can collaborate to be of service,\u201d said ASU President Michael Crow. \u201cASU believes that universities should be accessible wherever there is an opportunity to help learners and the community at large to thrive, and we\u2019re proud of the growth and experiences our downtown campus creates for learners and partners alike, as well as the robust, cross-sector network it has revitalized in the heart of our metro region.\u201dPrior to the Downtown Phoenix campus, ASU had never tried to sell an urban experience. Its establishment came as result of an unprecedented referendum.Public money was involved. The basketball arena was downtown, but unless there was a game, the streets were empty in the evenings. Civic leaders knew the area needed more to push it to the next level. And that included populating the area with students who would live, work, study and shop there.In short, these students would become citizens of the city and able to pursue their careers in a more dynamic arrangement.New York City has Columbia. Los Angeles has UCLA. Phoenix needed an urban university. But there was no need to create one from scratch.\u00a0What follows is the story of how a group of very determined people turned a napkin sketch into a viable 20-acre, multimillion-dollar university campus in a short amount of time that had skeptics wondering if it would ever really happen.Two decades ago, the streets of downtown Phoenix were populated by business people and the occasional event goer. Now students bring their energy and potential to ASU's campus, where a line of families moving students into the residence halls is a common sight each August. Photo by Charlie Leight/ASU NewsBreakfast of championsThe Downtown Phoenix campus wasn\u2019t initially created on an architect\u2019s draft table or an engineer\u2019s rendering. It was sketched on a plain, white restaurant napkin.It started with two great minds \u2014 and two empty stomachs \u2014 over breakfast in 2003. Crow and then-Mayor Phil Gordon wanted more than a satellite school. They wanted bacon and eggs \u2014 and they wanted thousands to live and study in downtown Phoenix for a very long time.\u201cOur first meeting took place at The Good Egg on Central and Camelback in Phoenix when I was running for Phoenix mayor,\u201d said Gordon, who won the race in September 2003 and served as Phoenix\u2019s mayor from 2004 to 2012. \u201cBringing ASU to the downtown area was one of things I pushed during my campaign. Dr. Crow said, \u2018Great idea. Come back \u2014 win or lose \u2014 and let\u2019s move this concept forward.'\u201dThey met again at the same restaurant shortly after Gordon\u2019s victory, vowing to work together to take the university, the city and the region to new heights. Gordon, a municipal leader unafraid of taking on challenges, and Crow, the academic visionary who felt that the old college system was broken and who had declared ASU the \u201cNew American University,\u201d seemed perfectly matched.Phoenix and the university\u2019s burgeoning popularity added pressure to act swiftly to create an environment that would attract a \u201ccreative class\u201d \u2014 people who would build a knowledge industry and develop technologies to nourish Arizona in the 21st century.Despite Phoenix\u2019s designation as one of the nation\u2019s largest cities, and its growth and prosperity in the new millennium, its core had been somewhat hollow, especially after business hours. Merging students, staff and faculty with merchants, artisans, government and nonprofits would inject a much needed, livelier ambiance in the city\u2019s core.It would also help accommodate ASU\u2019s booming numbers. In order to meet the projected growth in college-bound Arizona high school graduates, the university needed capacity. ASU began shifting its focus from Tempe to other campuses in the Valley to handle the overflow: ASU\u2019s West and Polytechnic campuses, and a small satellite facility at the Mercado at Seventh and Van Buren streets. Both Crow and Gordon knew expanding ASU to a full-scale campus in downtown Phoenix made perfect sense.ASU Adjunct Professor Isaac Easley takes a headshot of Cronkite News Sports team member Mariah Graves, a\u00a0graduate student in sports journalism, at the Cronkite News set on Aug. 19. The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication was one of the first colleges that moved to the Downtown Phoenix campus 15 years ago. Photo by Deanna Dent/ASU NewsA blueprint for maroon and goldThat napkin became ASU\u2019s blueprint \u2014 a campus geared toward city-minded students attracted to service-oriented careers. The area was teeming with government, media, nonprofit, legal, medical and business operations ripe for full- or part-time internships, mentoring and professional networking opportunities. The region\u2019s bevy of professional arts, dance, theater and music venues; sports stadiums; and fine and casual dining would cap off the university\u2019s unique work-study-live experience.A university design team, led by Wellington \u201cDuke\u201d Reiter, then dean of what was known as the College of Architecture and Environmental Design (now The Design School), said in early 2004 that he was pulled into Crow\u2019s office and asked if he could design an urban campus for ASU. There weren\u2019t yet too many hard-and-fast specifics, including which colleges would relocate downtown, but he was given one directive \u2014 have it done in 60 days.\u201cHow do you design a house before you know who the occupants are? How do you design a campus before you know which colleges will go there?\u201d Reiter said. \u201cThe only thing I really knew was the scope, which was, one day the campus would potentially serve 15,000 students, which was a start.\u201dReiter also enlisted noted and locally based architecture firms to think beyond the normal constraints of what might be possible. The firms included Will Bruder Architects, Architekton, SmithGroup and DeBartolo Architects.They collectively identified several universities \u2014 George Washington University in Washington, D.C.; New York University; Emerson College in Boston; and Savannah College of Arts and Design in Georgia \u2014 as excellent models of how an urban campus interacts with the community.Reiter also advocated for a civic space or multiuse park to be used by the students and general public. The idea was to bridge the city and the university, and offer community-related events, sponsored by both entities. The end result was a $34 million sustainable space that opened in 2009 called Civic Space Park.A university design team also spent several months deciding which colleges should relocate to the downtown campus. They ultimately chose: the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication; Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions; the Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation; and University College.A few years later the campus added the Sandra Day O\u2019Connor College of Law; College of Health Solutions; Thunderbird School of Global Management and the Graduate College. The College of Integrative Sciences and Arts; Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College; and Barrett, The Honors College also established a presence on the campus, as did a sprinkling of centers, think tanks and initiatives.Fusion on First, a combination high-rise residence hall and academic-entrepreneurship space, welcomed its first residents on Aug. 16. The first floor of the new building will offer some student amenities as well a makerspace. The second and third floors will feature academic space with fashion being prominent on the second floor and music programing on third. Photo by Charlie Leight/ASU NewsNo Plan BWhen the city and ASU unveiled its master plan to the community, it was met with mixed praise from the business community, local residents and most especially the media. Landholders debated whether or not to sell their property; private developers in the area wondered if they should get involved; residents didn\u2019t want the university to change the downtown\u2019s character. Some media openly questioned the viability of the project.There were some members on the home team who wondered aloud if the city\u2019s greatest revitalization project was really going to happen, given its collapsed timeline of getting the campus up and running by late August 2006.\u201cOne of the deans asked me early in the process what was \u2018Plan B\u2019?\u201d said Mernoy Harrison, former ASU executive vice president and chief financial officer, who was selected by Crow to oversee the completion of the campus. \u201cI told this person, \u2018There is no Plan B. It\u2019s do or die. We either launch this campus or die trying.\u201dHarrison\u2019s declaration soon became the battle cry for ASU and city of Phoenix employees, who designed, renovated and constructed a university campus in record-breaking time.But where to get the money?A 2006 Phoenix bond proposal would provide the necessary funds to build the campus. The proposal totaled $878.5 million for homeland security, education, parks, libraries, streets, fire stations and other city infrastructure and amenities. Of those funds, $223 million was earmarked for the ASU Downtown Phoenix campus \u2014 almost a fourth of the total and the largest single proposed bond expenditure.But it needed voter approval.That took place on March 14, 2006, winning over 60% of the vote according to the Associated Press. That was the good news. The bad \u2014 or at least stressful \u2014 news was that ASU and city officials had less than six months to renovate several buildings, purchase office supplies, equipment and furniture, strategize operations, move 600 faculty from the Tempe campus, and hire 80 new staff members, including the four founding deans. A tall order for a short window of time.School of Social Work graduate students Brandon Falk (left) and Ronald Bookman (right) chat with Westward Ho resident Douglas Meyer during an informal meetup in Civic Space Park in downtown Phoenix last winter. The social-hour activity was started by the ASU Community Collaborative as a way for residents to safely connect and is but one of many ways ASU students connect with the downtown community. Photo by Charlie Leight/ASU NewsThe planets alignConstruction crews scrambled, working around the clock while ASU burned the midnight oil planning for the massive four-college move \u2014 all while the new light rail system along Central Avenue was getting underway. Buildings were gutted and classrooms readied, while the torn-up streets made navigating a challenge.But then trucks and shipments with televisions, computers and furnishings started to arrive and, finally, it was done.\u201cAll the planets were aligned for this project,\u201d Reiter said. \u201cWe had a mayor who was ready to do something great; a governor who was predisposed towards higher education; a university president who was ready to build; a community who supported this idea; a bond election, which could fund this and make it a reality; and a thriving economy, which gave voters the confidence to make positive change. It was the right cast of characters at the right economic time.\u201dSeveral hundred dignitaries, employees, business owners and locals joined the Aug. 15, 2006, ribbon-cutting ceremony inside the University Center lobby to listen to special remarks from Gov. Janet Napolitano, Gordon and Crow, as well as take a tour of campus facilities. ASU\u2019s Downtown Phoenix campus went from brainstorming sketch to reality in just three short years.And that fall, it welcomed more than 3,000 full-time and 6,000 part-time students. Today, that number has almost quadrupled to more than 11,000 full-time students. One of them is Noah Furtado, a Hawaiian native who came to Phoenix to study journalism.\u201cI like that everything on the Downtown Phoenix campus is close by, and the longest walk I have to make for a class is about 15 minutes,\u201d Furtado said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really down-to-earth vibe here compared to Tempe. Everything is close by, and the people are close-knit.\u201dFurtado also likes the amenities at the Cronkite School and hanging out with like-minded students.\u201cI like the fact that the Cronkite building has a lot of editing bays, and you can go in there whenever you want to learn the craft and work with all of the different photo and video applications,\u201d Furtado said. \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to be around a lot of people who are passionate about the same thing you are. It\u2019s nice that we have a shared interest in sports journalism, and it\u2019s something that I didn\u2019t have with a lot of people back in Hawaii.\u201dAlso new to campus this year is Cronkite School Dean Battinto Batts Jr., who moved from Cincinnati this summer. He said living and working in downtown Phoenix has a vibrancy that he\u2019s enjoying.\u201cThe downtown Phoenix campus has grown tremendously over the course of the past decade and has been a powerful catalyst in the community\u2019s overall growth,\u201d Batts said. \u201cBeing new to ASU, I am currently living downtown while looking for permanent housing. The energy is so appealing that we\u2019re in no rush to leave. I am a believer in the role of higher education as transformers of communities. That role involves being a developer of buildings while also developing a vibe and a feel. Arizona State has accomplished both with its Downtown Phoenix campus, and I am excited to be a part of it.\u201dConstruction is in the final stages of the new home of the Thunderbird School of Global Management on the Downtown Phoenix campus, shown here Aug. 19. Photo by Deanna Dent/ASU NewsRoom to growThough it may seem to many that the campus has reached full maturation, it is in fact growing and still has room for expansion.This semester saw the opening of Fusion on First, a high-rise residential community at 380 N. First Ave. The building will include 13 floors of apartment-style student housing and several floors of classroom space, housing the fashion and popular music majors from the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts.Another building nearing completion is the new home of the Thunderbird School of Global Management, which announced its relocation to the Downtown Phoenix campus in 2017. Thunderbird\u2019s move from its former westside location to downtown Phoenix provides the opportunity to evaluate the curriculum and give them proximity to other ASU schools and colleges, while continuing to provide world-class global management and business education with a unique intercultural focus.Thunderbird\u2019s new building is between First and Second streets, just north of Polk Street. It includes space for classrooms, meetings, enclave and office space and will include two levels for executive education. There will also be rooftop function space.Ongoing plans for the campus include continued growth of the existing academic programs currently on the campus, which, over time, means the need for more classroom, office and residential space. In addition, downtown has become a major center for health and bioscience research, with the opening this year of the\u00a0Wexford Innovation Center on the Phoenix Biomedical Campus, which was another collaboration between the city of Phoenix and ASU, with the help of Wexford Science + Technology.TGen and private companies \u2014 along with all three state universities \u2014 are doing cutting-edge research to advance human health in the downtown area. ASU\u2019s College of Health Solutions and Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation are driving this research growth for ASU, and it is expected that additional university and private research activity will gravitate to and grow in the downtown area, along with the startups that emerge from this research.The Downtown Phoenix campus\u2019 launch and continued success is one of Gordon\u2019s proudest accomplishments in his eight years as Phoenix mayor.\u201cIt has succeeded way beyond anyone\u2019s expectations,\u201d said Gordon, who is now the director of the Chan Soon-Shiong Institute of Advanced Health, a data center dedicated to health information. \u201cIn addition to the campus, there\u2019s the outgrowth of apartments, houses, restaurants, bars, grocery stores, retail businesses and commercial buildings. The campus has totally redeveloped downtown Phoenix, and now other major cities want college campuses in their downtowns, too.\"Top photo:\u00a0Students make their way to classes at the Beus Center for Law and Society during the first day of fall 2021 classes on ASU's Downtown Phoenix campus Aug. 19.

        "body": "As a registered nurse, Jasmine Bhatti knows that patients leaving the hospital may still have a long road to full recovery. For people who don\u2019t have a network of family and friends to assist them after a hospitalization or surgery, the joy of going home can be tinged with anxiety.Bhatti had an idea that could help \u2014 a marketplace that connects nurses to patients and families who need medical guidance and support after a hospital stay or outpatient surgery. But with her intense schedule as a nurse caring for COVID-19 patients and as a PhD student at Arizona State University, coupled with a lack of business experience, Bhatti needed some help to get her company,\u00a0Navi Concierge Nurses, off the ground.\u201cMy co-founder and I are nurses, so our expertise is in clinical care. It was a challenge for us to learn so many different other business-related skills like accounting, financing, marketing, creating strategic partnerships and more,\u201d she said.Bhatti found the support she needed through the\u00a0J. Orin Edson Entrepreneurship + Innovation Institute, officially established in 2020. Innovative problem solving, transdisciplinary research and inclusivity for all learners has always been at the heart of the ASU Charter, but a generous gift from J. Orin Edson set the stage for an evolution of the concept \u2014 in perpetuity.The gift was a major milestone in the Edson family\u2019s long history of support to ASU.J. Orin Edson was, himself, the living embodiment of the entrepreneurial spirit. Deeply devoted to the community, he held the belief that talented and forward-thinking people like Bhatti should have the resources to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. Edson and his wife, Charlene, have been ASU benefactors since 2005.\u201cThe Edsons helped set ASU on a path to valuing entrepreneurship with their initial gift in 2005 establishing the Edson Student Entrepreneur Initiative. That gift enabled ASU to be the first investors, as the \u2018friends and family round,\u2019 to student-driven startups and the development of new solutions,\u201d said Ji Mi Choi, vice president for ASU\u2019s Knowledge Enterprise and founding executive director of the Edson Entrepreneurship + Innovation Institute.The Edson Student Entrepreneur Initiative has paved the way for nearly 300 student-led ventures, which have filed more than 40 patents and raised more than $46 million in external funding. In 2018, a second endowed gift supported Edson\u00a0Entrepreneurship + Innovation Institute training and development resources to accelerate innovation and entrepreneurship. It has also provided support for faculty to develop and offer extra- and co-curricular training utilizing a wide range of subject-matter expertise.Bhatti participated in the institute's\u00a0Venture Devils\u00a0and Venture Devils Plus programs, which currently include more than 700 teams. Since the start of the pandemic, both she and her co-founder have been focused on patient care in the hospital where they work. But in true entrepreneurial spirit, they have managed to grow their company in spite of trying circumstances. Bhatti said the institute's programs were influential in developing the clarity needed to design and actually create the business.\u201cWe were given the opportunity to connect with other professionals whose guidance helped us refine our strategies immensely,\u201d said Bhatti, who is now completing her dissertation in the\u00a0Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation, named through\u00a0a generous gift to ASU health care programs\u00a0from the Edson family in 2019. \u00a0Bhatti admits that balancing school, work and business ownership was a challenge, especially when paired with the emotional, mental and physical fatigue of caring for COVID-19 patients.\u201cI had to turn those painful emotions into fuel to propel this business forward,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you keep adding things to your plate and you have to figure it out as you go because everything becomes important. Right now for me, balance means just making sure I\u2019m getting good sleep, I get to see my loved ones and I\u2019m engaging in a handful of activities every day that bring me joy.\u201dEdson Entrepreneurship + Innovation empowers students to concurrently pursue education and entrepreneurship. While the primary focus of the institute is ASU students, faculty, staff and alumni, it also supports a diverse range of lifelong learners and entrepreneurs of every age, interest and socioeconomic background. ASU\u2019s entrepreneurship programs have received numerous\u00a0awards\u00a0over the years, including the Deshpande Symposium for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Higher Education, and the Global Consortium of Entrepreneurship Centers Award for Outstanding Contribution to Venture Creation.The Edsons\u2019 gracious contributions have allowed ASU to expand its portfolio of entrepreneurial programs and initiatives, as well as the depth and breadth of the programs.\u201cASU\u2019s commitment and leadership in innovation is evidenced with the establishment of the institute and enables us to materially follow through on taking fundamental responsibility for the economic and community development and well-being of the communities we serve,\u201d Choi said.\u201cIn addition to the stability of the institute serving as the foundation for entrepreneurial programming, we also galvanize support from many other philanthropic and funding sources to further the impact we have on advancing solutions \u2014 new products, new services and new processes \u2014 to address problems and unmet needs in society.\u201dOn top of collaborations with many ASU academic programs and colleges, Edson\u00a0Entrepreneurship + Innovation facilitates multiple funding opportunities, provides collaborative working spaces for ventures at all stages, and offers training and development resources, including a robust mentor network to help up-and-coming entrepreneurs find solid footing.Bhatti credits her own mentor, Rick Hall, with believing in her and encouraging her to apply to the Venture Devils program. Hall is director of the\u00a0Health Entrepreneurship Accelerator Lab\u00a0(HEALab), and assistant dean and clinical professor of health innovation programs at the Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation.\u201cHe connected us to a professor in the college of engineering who was able to help us create a prototype of our product,\u201d Bhatti said. \u201cHe connected us with the law school so that I could save money by having students help with some of my initial legal documents. Dr. Hall also introduced me to a handful of incredible people throughout the university who have become followers of what we are building.\u201dThrough hard work, perseverance and leveraging the resources available to them, Bhatti and her co-founder were ready to make their business happen by the end of last year. They began taking their first clients in January 2021, went from zero to more than 90 nurses in their network, and have made almost $500,000 to date.What advice would Bhatti offer other student entrepreneurs?\u201cIt may sound kind of silly,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think that my idea was enough to really go and ask for help. In hindsight, I don\u2019t want any student to ever think that. If anyone ever tells you that you have a good idea, roll with it. Believe in yourself as much as others believe in you. Especially in the beginning.\u201cI promise that once you start to see what you are building is meaningful, you will understand the power of your idea. All it takes is the spark. The university has all the fuel to help the flames grow and spread.\u201dTop photo:\u00a0Jasmine Bhatti, founder of Navi Concierge Nurses and PhD student in the Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation.

        "body": "Times Higher Education rankings released today place Arizona State University in the top 8% of worldwide universities, and among the top 50 in the United States.ASU tied for No. 132 out of 1,662 institutions across the globe, a jump from its 2020 ranking of No. 184 worldwide out of 1,527.The university also ranks in the top 25% of U.S. higher education institutions, coming in at No. 45 out of 183, ahead of Rice University, the University of Arizona, Northeastern University and the University of Notre Dame.\u00a0\u201cArizona State University has sharpened its focus and used its creativity and resources to meet the challenges of the past year in a way that has advanced both our standards of excellence and our commitment to student access and success,\u201d ASU President Michael Crow said. \u201cThe resiliency that has driven our progress will continue to provide the foundation for the way we advance in an economy and in a world where universities must do more than ever, and we believe our climb in the rankings is a reflection of these efforts.\u201dThe Times Higher Education World University Rankings judge research-intensive universities across all their core missions: teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook.This year\u2019s rankings reflected a significant boost to citation impact for those universities that published medical sciences research related to COVID-19, but the organization said it was unclear whether the pandemic would reshape or entrench existing hierarchies in higher education. The 2022 version of the rankings, released today, draws on data on research published between 2016 and 2020, and citations made between 2016 and 2021.David Watkins, head of data science at Times Higher Education, said the citations effect was \u201cto be expected given that COVID-19 has had such an impact worldwide.\u201d\u201cResearch into the disease, and especially work on vaccines, was heavily funded and prioritized, and some papers have attracted more than 20,000 citations within a year of publication,\u201d he said in the rankings\u2019 official release.\u201cBecause (Times Higher Education) uses a five-year window for publications, we believe that this effect will remain noticeable in the rankings for some time, and it is likely that other COVID-related effects, such as reputational impact \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 and income, will also become visible.\u201dThe rankings\u2019 performance indicators are grouped into five pillars: teaching (the learning environment); research (volume, income and reputation); citations (research influence); international outlook (staff, students and research); and industry income (knowledge transfer). ASU\u2019s top pillar is research (No. 129).Advancing research and discovery of public value is a key part of the charter of ASU, where there is an emphasis on research with real-world impact. Earlier this year, ASU moved up to sixth out of 759 universities in the nation for total research expenditures among universities without a medical school, according to the latest National Science Foundation Higher Education Research and Development (HERD) rankings. For fiscal year 2019, ASU had nearly $640 million in research expenditures.\u201cMeasuring research expenditures is a useful proxy for measuring what really matters: impact,\u201d said Sally C. Morton, executive vice president of Knowledge Enterprise at ASU. \u201cWe measure our success not by grant dollars awarded, but by lives improved, because we believe deeply in a university\u2019s moral imperative to bring radical advancement to the communities it serves \u2014 locally, nationally and globally.\u201d]]>",

        "body": "Research has shown that excessive alcohol use disproportionately affects Black American college students, who experience more negative social and health consequences from drinking than their white peers.A new study from Arizona State University and Virginia Commonwealth University has found that racial discrimination can lead to depressive symptoms and to problem alcohol consumption in Black American college students. Problem drinking is more common in college students than young adults who do not attend college, but the disparity in how alcohol use affects different people is not well understood in large part because there are few studies on minority populations. This work, which was published in Psychology of Addictive Behaviors in August, examined the pathways that lead to and protect against alcohol use problems in Black American college students.\u201cBlack American college students drink less than their peers but are more likely to have problems from drinking. Understanding what the risks and protective factors are for this group is important,\u201d said\u00a0Jinni Su, assistant professor of psychology at ASU and first author on the paper. \u201cRacial discrimination was related to worse mental health outcomes, which increased the risk for alcohol use and related problems.\u201dDiscrimination is a known stressor that can lead to using alcohol as a coping mechanism.\u00a0\u201cWhen people experience stress and lack strong coping skills or resources, they can turn to alcohol or substance abuse as a coping mechanism. We know from previous research that people who experience racial and ethnic discrimination are more likely to have problems related to excessive drinking,\u201d Su said.Racial discrimination was associated with alcohol use in two groups of Black American college students. The connection between the two was changes in mental health, in the form of increased depressive symptoms.\u201cRacial discrimination increased the risk for alcohol use and related problems, and this relationship was linked to worse mental health outcomes,\u201d Su said.The research team also examined whether how people think about their identity was protective against problem alcohol use. They assessed the impact of an individual having positive feelings about being a Black American and the belief that society at large has positive views about Black people.Participants who had positive feelings about being a Black American had a weaker link between discrimination, mental health and alcohol use. But, the association between racial discrimination, mental health and alcohol use was stronger for the participants who thought that society viewed Black people positively.\u00a0\u201cThe impact of racial discrimination is not equal for everybody; it varies in part based on beliefs about identity,\u201d Su said. \u201cWe found that participants who felt good about being Black were buffered from the effects of how discrimination might impact their mental health and drinking behavior. We also found that participants who think other people view them positively were more negatively impacted by discrimination, possibly because it is harder to understand unfair treatment.\u201dEleanor Seaton, professor in the T. Denny Sanford School of Social and Family Dynamics, also contributed to the work along with Chelsea Williams, the Spit for Science Working Group and Danielle Dick from Virginia Commonwealth University.This study was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Center for Research Resources, National Institutes of Health Roadmap for Medical Research, National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Virginia Commonwealth University.]]>",

        "body": "Ross Emmett, director of Arizona State University\u2019s Center for the Study of Economic Liberty and professor at the School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership, recently began his term as president of the History of Economics Society, an organization dedicated to \u201cencouraging interest, fostering scholarship and promoting discussion among scholars and professionals in the field of history of economics and related disciplines.\u201dFollowing the organization\u2019s constitutional guidelines, Emmett will serve for two years as president of the society, having already served two years as the elected vice president. According to Emmett, this allows the society\u2019s elected officials a reasonable time in office for accomplishment of their most important duty: planning and hosting conferences that provide a forum for established and young scholars to advance new ideas and research. Young scholars can apply for funding for the conference through the Warren and Sylvia Samuels Fund, a resource dedicated to the promotion of young academics.\u00a0Emmett sees the History of Economics Society conferences as a great opportunity to \u201cprovide mentorship to young scholars \u2026 and have senior scholars comment on their scholarship.\u201d As a young scholar, Emmett won best dissertation in 1992 for his work, \u201cThe Economist as Philosopher: Frank H. Knight and American Social Science During the Twenties and Thirties.\u201dMore than 300 international members of the History of Economics Society will be invited to meet in Vancouver, British Columbia, in January 2023 to discuss research materials and papers in the conference curated by Emmett and his team. Conference sessions and themes are organized around papers and research proposals submitted well in advance of the meeting; this approach allows for submissions from a broad range of thoughts and ideas, rather than responses to a prescriptive call.\u00a0Per Emmett: \u201cWe want everyone to attend. We get Marxists and libertarians, conservatives and liberals, historians and philosophers.\u201d Emmett, a self-described member of \"the dismal science,\" corrected the author\u2019s admiration for this egalitarian approach, insisting that pragmatism is the driving factor. He is an economist, after all.Since joining ASU in 2018, Emmett has taught three different history of economics-related courses and is regularizing a cross-listed history of economic thought course with the School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership and the W. P. Carey Department of Economics. As director of the Center for the Study of Economic Liberty, Emmett organized and held the Winter Institute for the History of Economic Thought in 2019 and 2020, and he is planning for the 2022 offering. Additionally, center researchers publish an annual report titled \u201cDoing Business North America,\" a project that \u201cannually provides objective measures of the scale and scope of business regulations in 130 cities across 92 states, provinces and federal districts of the U.S., Canada and Mexico. It uses these measures to score and rank cities in regard to how easy or difficult it is to set up, operate and shut down a business.\u201dA fuller description of Emmett\u2019s research and teaching can be found in his ASU profile.\u00a0Most recently, Emmett has started a new research program, Economists on the Indigenous Peoples of North America, with the first foray into the subject being a paper titled \u201cFrank Amasa Walker and the Indigenous Peoples of North America.\u201d This will be presented at the January 2022 Allied Social Science Association meeting, which is the largest gathering of economists globally, with more than 13,000 attendees.]]>",

        "title": "Hundreds of AZ students are college ready, thanks to ASU summer camps",
        "body": "College readiness, career inspiration and Sun Devil pride were on full display at the nine Access ASU summer camps that reached 726 middle and high schoolers in June and July.\u00a0Every summer, GEAR UP, Clubes de Ciencia, Poly Summer Leadership Academy, Summer Experience at West, Inspire, Barrett Summer Scholars, First Star, the C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Leadership Institute and the RISE Leadership Institute share resources and information that students need to be prepared for college financially, socially and academically.\u00a0For the past two years, the format was adapted to a virtual environment, but in previous years, the events ranged from day camps to residential college experiences, which allow students to live on campus for a week. All participants get a taste of campus life while also receiving hands-on instruction in both academics and college readiness. Faculty, community and ASU student support helps make the camps enriching experiences that students don\u2019t soon forget.\u00a0Current ASU student Emilia Ba\u00f1uelos, a speech and hearing sciences and family and human development major, was a 2016 C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Leadership Institute participant. After her experience at the camp, she said she was inspired to serve as a facilitator.\u201cWhen I saw that Access ASU was hiring summer mentors for various programs, including (C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Leadership Institute), I applied within the hour because these programs not only create leaders but a supportive community,\u201d Ba\u00f1uelos said.\u00a0She remembers her time at the\u00a0C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Leadership Institute fondly. What particularly stuck out was learning to avoid making assumptions, how first impressions matter and the power of a firm handshake. Ba\u00f1uelos said that the camp helped her realize all the opportunities that ASU students have to make a difference in the community.\u00a0\u201cAttending these programs sets you in motion to be a high-achieving student, a leader in your community,\u201d she said.\u00a0Post-event surveys confirm that participants leave with tremendous knowledge and inspiration about what it takes to get to college and what fields they want to consider.\u00a0 Surveys reveal it\u2019s nearly unanimous that respondents feel prepared and confident in the steps they need to take to prepare for college, to pay for college and to prepare for the admissions process.\u00a0Applications open in December for the 2022 programs. Camps are available at all four ASU campuses and involve a variety of hands-on coursework and training in leadership, engineering, critical thinking, electives, financial aid presentations and much more. Tours of the four unique campuses and tips about ASU resources, such as me3, an online tool that helps students connect their interests to future careers and fields of study, are also included.One Barrett Summer Scholars participant said that they were excited for the work and also the information about becoming a Sun Devil.\u00a0\u201cBarrett Summer Scholars was an amazing experience because I learned so much in my classes, and I also learned about ASU as a school. I would like to go to ASU someday, (and I enjoyed) seeing the campus through the virtual tours. I am so glad that I got to attend Barrett Summer Scholars, and I hope I get to next year,\u201d they wrote.\u00a0Access ASU\u2019s summer camps serve many Arizona students, and recruitment includes special outreach to first-generation and underrepresented students. Scholarships are available for all camps and summer programs.The camps all offer scholarships.Summer Experience at West is a program at ASU\u2019s West campus that was launched by Jose E. N\u00e1\u00f1ez Sr., ASU President\u2019s Professor of psychology, to help prepare students for college life, inspired by his own experience of having no role models as a Mexican American student.\u00a0\n  Video of PSLA - Summer 2021 Wrap-Up\n\nVideo courtesy of Educational Outreach and Student ServicesChaparral High School junior Renee Hsu was a Summer Experience at West participant in 2021 who appreciated being surrounded by people who had similar interests and motivation.\u201cI thoroughly enjoyed my professors, who have incredible experience and an amazing amount of knowledge that I am so grateful that they were willing to share with us,\u201d she said.\u00a0Some of the academic topics covered at Summer Experience at West included neuroscience, law, forensics and STEM.The Poly Summer Leadership Academy is usually held on ASU\u2019s Polytechnic campus in Mesa, and the virtual event in 2021 included panel discussions led by ASU students and faculty, in addition to college-level academic content on attachment, psychotherapy, education and sustainability. \u00a0One survey respondent said that they especially appreciated the tips to get motivated and establish good habits.\u00a0\u201cI received so much information, resources and instruction about getting to college, picking my major, finding my niche in life, earning scholarships and helping me build a career path with a solid set of goals,\u201d they said. \u201cPoly Summer Leadership Academy truly was a major stepping stone to creating future leaders of all different types of backgrounds wherever they may go.\u201dMarcelino Quin\u0303onez,\u00a0Access ASU director of community outreach and partnerships,\u00a0said that this year\u2019s camps showed the resilience and motivation of the next generation of college students.\u201cThe resources to get to college are out there, and the talent of Arizona students is something that always inspires us,\u201d Quin\u0303onez said. \u201cASU has so much to offer students to inspire and assist them in being college ready, and seeing these students\u2019 persistence after the learning disruptions we\u2019ve seen is simply amazing.\u201dSomething that is emphasized at each camp, aside from getting into college and exploring majors, is the idea of creating leaders and people who can improve their communities. As an alum of the C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Leadership Institute, Ba\u00f1uelos saw that idea come full circle in the students who led at the camp this year.\u00a0\u201cMy biggest takeaway from being a summer program leader was seeing the programs transform students into student leaders. I thought it was amazing how in only a week, students who were shy were leading the conversation,\u201d Ba\u00f1uelos said. \u201cThese programs are an amazing opportunity to learn more about ASU and prepare you for greatness. When you do attend the wonderful Access ASU programs, do not be afraid to put yourself out there.\u201dRegistration for 2022 camps begins in December.

        "body": "Microwaves do more than just heat up your leftovers. These invisible waves of electromagnetic radiation can also be used in a variety of imaging applications.From observing the Earth\u2019s climate and surface topography to screening baggage at airports, microwaves can help us see things that may be hidden. That is because different frequencies of microwaves can penetrate objects that would normally block our vision in the visible light spectrum \u2014 such as clouds or the outer layer of a suitcase.However, the limitations of microwave imaging are the unfavorable size, weight, power consumption and cost of the systems. These factors limit their use to applications such as bulky scanners at airports or large satellites in orbit.Mohammadreza Imani, an assistant professor of electrical engineering in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University, is looking to overcome these challenges by making microwave imaging systems more portable and accessible.His research focuses on one particular area of opportunity for microwave imaging: using metamaterials \u2014 engineered combinations of elements that have unique patterns or structures not found in nature \u2014 to simplify microwave imaging hardware and make it easier to generate images.Imani shares how to improve microwave imaging using metamaterials and how this new way of \u201cseeing\u201d can help inspect buildings, aid in search and rescue efforts, speed up airport security and even assist in our own home improvement projects.Mohammadreza Imani, an assistant professor of electrical engineering in the Ira A.

A crucial one is the antenna hardware.Think of a security screening system at an airport. This system has a mechanical arm equipped with many antennas that scan around the person. Though it can capture fantastic images, it is expensive, bulky and slow.Metamaterials offer a simple way to get several measurements of a particular scene of interest. In essence, they can alleviate the need for mechanical movement or using very large antenna arrays.Metamaterials consist of many inclusions, or encapsulated compounds in the material\u2019s structure, that resonate when an electromagnetic wave interacts with them. Their resonance response determines the patterns generated.By designing metamaterial structures that exhibit specific resonance responses as a function of frequency or electronic signals, we can generate diverse patterns that interrogate the scene of interest and obtain several measurements of the scene.In this manner, we can replace multiple antennas with a single one that is fashioned with metamaterial structures. When we reduce the number of antennas and mechanical motion, we can make imaging systems faster and simpler.Q: How else do metamaterials address microwave imaging challenges?A:\u00a0We can leverage metamaterials\u2019 dynamic and diverse interactions with a scene to obtain enough measurements to form an image even at a single frequency. Other imaging systems use several frequencies over a wide bandwidth.Bandwidth, or the range of electromagnetic frequencies used, is usually a huge bottleneck in microwave imaging. Many devices operate in microwaves \u2014 ranging from microwave ovens to reconnaissance radars. When using a large bandwidth for microwave imaging, we increase the chances of interfering with other devices. Wide bandwidth also usually increases the complexity and cost of the devices. Further, in the case of imaging through surfaces, using wideband electromagnetic waves can cause image distortion.Using a single frequency, or a very narrow bandwidth, solves the problems associated with wide bandwidth, which is where my research comes into play. Reconfigurable metamaterials provide a simple means to realize imaging systems that use a single frequency.Q: What is innovative about your approach to developing imaging technology?A:\u00a0The innovation at the heart of using metamaterials to obtain diverse measurements comes from the application of computational imaging. In this framework, computational post-processing is used to retrieve the desired image instead of relying solely on hardware components.This change of roles has immense benefits in terms of imaging speed and hardware complexity, and it allows us to use unconventional hardware such as metamaterials.Q: Can you \u201csee\u201d through walls with this technology?A: Seeing through layers has always been a fascinating idea in science fiction. However, that is not quite what is possible when we use microwave imaging to see through opaque layers. The resulting images may not easily be interpretable by the human eye but the measurements they produce carry a lot of information.The images obtained using microwave imaging can be used to examine structural integrity, detect structural damages, such as water leaks and cracks; locate items of interest, such as pipes or studs; or find and count the number of humans beyond walls, for example, in rescue operations. You can also use microwave imaging to inspect packages or backpacks, for example, to detect concealed threats.Q: How can microwave imaging technology be used to ensure infrastructure is safe?A: Microwave imaging enables nondestructive and usually noncontact evaluation and monitoring of different layers of infrastructure.It can even provide information about optically invisible layers. For example, it can detect cracks that may be invisible to the eye or provide information about a crack\u2019s depth. If we can make a microwave imaging system more easily deployable and portable, it can be used in a range of applications, like examining building integrity and aiding restoration and repair projects.Q: How can it be used in search and rescue operations?A: Microwaves are reflected by the human body, but they go through most other optically opaque layers, such as buildings and fabric. That means a microwave imaging device can in principle locate a person by \u201clooking through\u201d walls or wreckage in disasters such as earthquakes, building collapses or fires. To bring these potentials to widespread use, we need to improve the speed and size of microwave imaging systems, as well as associated image processing techniques.Q: How else could this imaging technology improve people\u2019s lives?A: If we can speed up data acquisition, we can eliminate the need for the stop-and-go process used currently at airports. Microwave imaging can be used in crowded places like stadiums, train stations, schools, hospitals and more as a simple and fast security screening device. As passengers pass through a corridor, the microwave imaging system can detect suspicious objects. Keep in mind that microwave imaging can also see through backpacks and luggage. Fast and affordable microwave imaging may thus detect potential threats concealed in backpacks in crowded areas, without requiring everyone to take them off.On a domestic basis, a fast and deployable microwave imaging system can be used in DIY projects, repairs, inspections or just for fun. When starting a DIY home improvement project, or doing an inspection of a house, one wants to know about the material behind walls, roofs or ceilings. For example, has the insulation settled down? Is there water leakage? Is there a pipe or wire behind the wall I am about to drill into? An affordable microwave camera can provide the answers to such problems.One can also just use the microwave camera for fun applications, such as checking how your foot fits within a shoe or discovering the contents of your gifts before opening them.Top image courtesy of Pexels.]]>",
