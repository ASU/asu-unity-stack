These are equally critical for those seeking careers in creative industries and industries that use design thinking. These abilities rely on the development of social capital. Students in this program have the ability to build sustainable, trusting relationships --- the basis of social capital --- with others from diverse parts of the world by developing a deep capacity for intercultural empathy, the ability to have an interpersonal impact and the ability to act with diplomacy. This program is designed to develop a student's social capital through field-based action learning, team-based projects and stretch assignments. This concentration is offered in collaboration with the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts: <a href=\"https://herbergerinstitute.asu.edu/\">https://herbergerinstitute.asu.edu</a>.</p><p><strong>Inventive thinking. Innovative leadership.</strong><br />There is an entrepreneurial skills gap among traditional art and design graduates, which can be filled by this program. The National Strategic National Arts Alumni Project survey of over 100,000 art and design graduates indicates that while 77% of architecture graduates and 75% of fine arts graduates believe entrepreneurial skills to be somewhat or very important, only 24% and 21% respectively gained the necessary entrepreneurial knowledge and skills as undergraduates.</p><p>The MGM program with a concentration in creative industries and design thinking teaches students critical skills with an interdisciplinary focus to meet a current need in the globally expanding field of creative industries. Additionally, providing students with an entrepreneurial skill set strengthens their ability to connect interdisciplinary knowledge of the cultural industries with design thinking methodology, building on management skills and the ability to apply entrepreneurial vision to the globally interconnected sector of art and design. Students are exposed to design-thinking pedagogy as they increase their capacity for interpersonal communication, public communication, opportunity recognition, network and systems thinking, problem recognition and creativity, as well as demonstrated abilities in cultural leadership, knowledge of the creative industries, distribution of creative products, the creative process and management of innovation in the creative industries.</p><p>This master's degree program empowers students to advance innovation in the cultural sector, support creative work and careers, harness social capital  and design public and private enterprises that will strengthen arts and design in the future. The program prepares graduates to understand the complex economic, legal, political and social contexts that surrounds any innovation or enterprise.</p><p>Thunderbird School of Global Management has produced unique leaders for more than 70 years, leaders in every sector capable of tackling the world's greatest challenges.

Graduates master a range of methods to inform strategy for specific outcomes.</p><p>This concentration is perfect for students who are interested in expanding and refining their digital skills in the areas of marketing, design and product development to complement a strong core of global leadership and management skills. A Master of Global Management from Thunderbird with a concentration in digital audience strategy prepares graduates to take on leadership roles around the world in industries such as entertainment, journalism, public relations, marketing and many others.</p><p>Thunderbird School of Global Management has produced principled, agile leaders for 75 years, leaders in every sector capable of tackling the world's greatest challenges.

Students can tailor this cutting-edge academic concentration to fit their specific learning goals. Through collaborative courses offered in partnership with other ASU colleges, students may combine the global management skills gained in the Master of Global Management with digital expertise to create a dual specialization that will continue to be in high demand throughout the global economy.</p><p><strong>A new brand of leadership: global, digital, cross-sectoral, transdisciplinary.</strong><br />The World Economic Forum reports that empathy and collaboration are two critical abilities for a global manager's success. These abilities are equally critical for those seeking careers in global digital transformation. They are skills that rely on the development of social capital. This program is designed to develop a student's social capital through field-based action learning, team-based projects and stretch assignments. Students can build sustainable trusting relationships --- the basis of social capital --- with others from diverse parts of the world. By developing a deep capacity for intercultural empathy, mastering interpersonal communication and negotiation skills, and cultivating the ability to act with diplomacy, graduates are prepared to take on a leadership role in a global organization.</p><p>Digital transformation leadership is a highly sought after expertise. However, technical skills need to be supplemented with a strong repertoire of management and collaboration skills. The Master of Global Management program with a concentration in global digital transformation expands students' choices of electives and fuses technological skills with managerial skills. In this concentration, students combine the global management skills of the Master of Global Management with digital expertise by specializing in the various pathways of global digital transformation through program coursework and applied learning projects guided by our faculty experts.</p><p>*As a bonus for international students, this program meets special F-1 international student status requirements. This means that international students who graduate with the global digital transformation concentration qualify for a 24-month extension to their Optional Practical Training in the United States beyond the 12 months already provided to international students in non-STEM degrees.</p><p>Thunderbird School of Global Management has produced unique leaders for more than 70 years, leaders in every sector capable of tackling the world's greatest challenges. The alumni network comprises 45,000 graduates and 170 chapters around the globe.</p>",

Increasingly, these innovative activities were triggered by opportunities rather than by the kinds of necessity that historically drove creativity for many decades around the world. The new digital technological transformation has created tremendous opportunities and led to an increase in the need for new, creative ventures. Additionally, the report also found that the change in attitude toward entrepreneurship and regulations in various countries had sparked and perpetuated entrepreneurship activities.</p><p>To meet this market need, Thunderbird has designed the global entrepreneurship concentration within the school's top-ranked MGM degree program.</p><p>This concentration is offered to students who are interested in starting their own business or who need to be entrepreneurial in the organizations they work for. This concentration sharpens entrepreneurial skills, helps develop business plans for global enterprises and promotes innovation and economic growth globally.</p><p>The World Economic Forum reports that empathy and collaboration are two critical abilities for a global leader's success. These abilities are equally critical for those seeking careers in global entrepreneurship, and they rely on the development of social capital. This academic concentration is designed to develop a student's social capital through field-based action learning, team-based projects and stretch assignments. Students learn and master proven methods and techniques to build sustainable, trusting relationships --- the basis of social capital --- with others from diverse parts of the world, developing intercultural empathy, the ability to have an interpersonal impact and the mental dexterity to act with diplomacy.</p><p>Global entrepreneurs are innovators who use their international business acumen and professional connections to identify transnational and cross-cultural opportunities, turning them into new value-generating initiatives. The Master of Global Management program with a concentration in global entrepreneurship provides a broad foundation of international business knowledge and sharpens students' entrepreneurial skills by helping develop business plans for global enterprises. This concentration offers learning opportunities specifically designed to foster innovation and economic growth worldwide to stimulate the growth of students into global entrepreneurs. Students build on a base of skills in areas such as finance and accounting with specialized education in research, pitching business ideas and analyzing markets for the viability of new products and services.</p><p>Thunderbird School of Global Management has produced unique leaders for more than 70 years, leaders in every sector capable of tackling the world's greatest challenges.

This mismatch between millennials' desire for meaningful work and their relatively low representation in the public sector highlights that many public administration programs are not meeting current market conditions. New programs are needed that integrate expert training in public administration with global management. To meet this new need, Thunderbird School of Global Management has created the public administration concentration in the highly ranked MGM degree program in collaboration with ASU's Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions: <a href=\"https://publicservice.asu.edu/\">https://publicservice.asu.edu/</a>.</p><p>This concentration is intended for future leaders who want public service skills and experience as part of their global management repertoire and for students seeking roles within public institutions or roles that interact with those institutions, especially on matters where public policy overlaps with business or other global enterprises. The concentration in public administration is designed by Thunderbird's renowned faculty and allows students to take courses in public administration through Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions.</p><p>Students earn a broad skill set and solid foundational understanding of public administration, leadership, management and policy analysis in service to the public good.
