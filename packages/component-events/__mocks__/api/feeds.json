There is beauty everywhere.”The exhibit will be on display until early December.",

Included in the collection is a rare signed first edition of Richard Wagner’s Das Rheingold with an inscription to the 19th century poet Mathilde Wesendonck with whom he had a brief but scandalous affair. Another noteworthy score in the collection is a presentation copy of Reynaldo Hahn’s La Carmélite to Jules Massenet, his teacher and mentor. This exhibit will be on display in the Music Library, part of the ASU Library, from August 19 to December 20. For further information, please contact Robert Mills at robert.mills@asu.edu or Linda Elsasser at linda.elsasser@asu.edu ",

            "full_body": "“Point Cloud (ASU)” is a newly commissioned artwork by Leo Villareal designed specifically for the ASU Art Museum in the Nelson Fine Arts Center. During his visit to the ASU Art Museum, Villareal was inspired by the museum’s architecture, designed by Antoine Predock in 1987. Villareal used mobile 3D scan technology to map both the inside and outside of the building, creating over 200,000,000 data points. The artist then manipulated the data points with his own custom software to create this public artwork. This is the first time Villareal has used actual data sampled from a location as part of an artwork. Leo Villareal, “Point Cloud (ASU)” is part of the ASU Art Museum’s Halle Public Art Initiative and is generously supported by The Diane and Bruce Halle Foundation with additional funding by the Herberger Institute Dean’s Creativity Council and organized in collaboration with ASU's Roden Crater Initiative. It was produced as a collaboration between the ASU Art Museum and the Los Angeles County Art Museum (LACMA).Image credit: Leo Villareal, “Point Cloud (ASU),” 2020, 12’ 10” x 3’ 3” x 1’ 1”, LEDs, custom software, electrical hardware, steel.

There is beauty everywhere.”The exhibit will be on display until early December.",

Included in the collection is a rare signed first edition of Richard Wagner’s Das Rheingold with an inscription to the 19th century poet Mathilde Wesendonck with whom he had a brief but scandalous affair. Another noteworthy score in the collection is a presentation copy of Reynaldo Hahn’s La Carmélite to Jules Massenet, his teacher and mentor. This exhibit will be on display in the Music Library, part of the ASU Library, from August 19 to December 20. For further information, please contact Robert Mills at robert.mills@asu.edu or Linda Elsasser at linda.elsasser@asu.edu ",

During his visit to the ASU Art Museum, Villareal was inspired by the museum’s architecture, designed by Antoine Predock in 1987. Villareal used mobile 3D scan technology to map both the inside and outside of the building, creating over 200,000,000 data points. The artist then manipulated the data points with his own custom software to create this public artwork. This is the first time Villareal has used actual data sampled from a location as part of an artwork. Leo Villareal, “Point Cloud (ASU)” is part of the ASU Art Museum’s Halle Public Art Initiative and is generously supported by The Diane and Bruce Halle Foundation with additional funding by the Herberger Institute Dean’s Creativity Council and organized in collaboration with ASU's Roden Crater Initiative. It was produced as a collaboration between the ASU Art Museum and the Los Angeles County Art Museum (LACMA).Image credit: Leo Villareal, “Point Cloud (ASU),” 2020, 12’ 10” x 3’ 3” x 1’ 1”, LEDs, custom software, electrical hardware, steel.

There is beauty everywhere.”The exhibit will be on display until early December.",

            "full_body": "A new exhibit at the Music Library on the Tempe campus features a collection of 11 signed opera scores — all first and early editions — by Wagner, Rossini, Verdi, Massenet, Puccini, Poulenc, Hahn, Thomas, Saint-Saëns and Gounod.The signed opera scores are from the collection of ASU faculty member Robert Mills, a clinical assistant professor of music and the vocal coach/accompanist for ASU’s Lyric Opera Theater, part of the School of Music, Dance and Theatre, within the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts.These autographs and inscriptions serve as physical reminders in our modern world of quintessential opera composers from the 19th and 20th centuries. Included in the collection is a rare signed first edition of Richard Wagner’s Das Rheingold with an inscription to the 19th century poet Mathilde Wesendonck with whom he had a brief but scandalous affair. Another noteworthy score in the collection is a presentation copy of Reynaldo Hahn’s La Carmélite to Jules Massenet, his teacher and mentor. This exhibit will be on display in the Music Library, part of the ASU Library, from August 19 to December 20. For further information, please contact Robert Mills at robert.mills@asu.edu or Linda Elsasser at linda.elsasser@asu.edu ",
