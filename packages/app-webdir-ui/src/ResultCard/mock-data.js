Contact Trademark Licensing for information regarding state and international registrations and other trademark and tradename protections. Other basic information about ASU’s trademarks is located in the university policy .ASU only permits logo and trademark use that reflects positively on ASU.

The most common ones include the following: Arizona State University® Learn to thrive® Sun Devils® Sun Devil® ASU® Fear the fork® Thunderbird® Universal Learner® ASU Universal Learning® SkySong® Skysong Innovations® ASU Online® Decision Theater® Special notes: “Arizona State,” though one of ASU’s registered marks and common nationwide, is not an acceptable self-reference outside of Sun Devil Athletics usage. While they are not included on the chart of federally registered and pending marks linked in the beginning of this section, there are several marks that qualify for the ™ designation: A New American University™ Sun Devil Stadium™ Devils™ Go Devils™ It’s Time™ Forks up™ Fork \'em™ Fork \'em Devils™ Universal Learning™ If you have questions about the use of any mark, please contact Trademark Licensing . For a complete list of all pending and registered marks, please visit: ASU pending and registered trademarks with the United States trademark office. Please note, while a registration is pending, it is appropriate to use ™. Pending registrations are identified in the linked chart for your convenience. The status of any mark can change; therefore, you should consult the chart each time you intend to reproduce a university mark. It is required to use the proper designation on all of the university’s registered/pending logos and wordmarks, mascot, seal and tag lines in all publications, printed uses and on all products. In publications and printed materials, the first use of each mark in the "trademark sense" should carry the ™ or ®, as appropriate. "Trademark sense" is when you can replace ™ or ® with the word "brand" and it makes sense, i.e., Sun Devil® (brand) entertainment. In addition, in all cases the ™ or ® should be easily legible. When using trademark registrations in legal notices and documents, the mark should appear in all caps. For promotional and marketing materials, the ASU brand guide stipulates uppercase and lowercase lettering only. Examples of trademark use Correct: Sun Devil® Athletics ( Incorrect: I am a Sun Devil®.) Correct: Decision Theater® analytic services ( Incorrect: Go to ASU’s Decision Theater®.) Correct: I bought an ASU® license plate. ( Incorrect: I am an ASU® student.)
