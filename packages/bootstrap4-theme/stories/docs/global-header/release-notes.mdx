# Release Notes

Individual components within the Web Standards 2.0 Bootstrap library are not typically versioned independently of one another. However, due to the complexity of this particular set of code, it may be beneficial to understand what has changed between major NPM package updates. This becomes particularly relevant when there are both markup changes and CSS changes.

Latest edits.

- NPM Package 1.1.x
- NPM Package 1.0.x
