# UDS Grid Links

The recommended markup for a "grid links" section is a list of links wrapped in a generic `<div>`.

```
<div className="uds-grid-links">
  <a href="#"><span className="fa fa-fw fa-generic-icon"></span>Icon and Link Text</a>
  <a href="#">Just a link</a>
  ...
</div>
```

<div className="pt-4">&nbsp;</div>

# Modifiers for desktop views

In addition to the required `uds-grid-links` class, there are two additional class modifiers that can control the number of columns present in your link grid, as well as the point at which the display will become mobile-first. (The mobile display is a single column of grid links.)

## Column modifiers

Use one of the following classes to produce a grid containing the specified number of columns.

- `two-columns` for a 2 column format.
- `three-columns` for a 3 column format.
- `four-columns` for a 4 column format.

Note that the classes above are different than the Bootstrap utility classes to control a column layout on a page.

## Background Colors

Add a background color and change the foregrround color of the `.uds-grid-links` component to match.

- First, wrap the `uds-grid-links` element in a container.
- Apply a utility background color class to that container. Use either `uds-gray-1` or `uds-gray-7` for light gray or dark backgrounds.
- Add appropriate padding to the container.
- Include a the appropriate `text-color` utility class to modify the foreground color, if needed.

```
<section className="bg-gray-7 p-8">
  <div className="uds-grid-links text-white">
    ...
  </div>
</section>
```

<div className="pt-4">&nbsp;</div>

# Additional notes

When using Font Awesome icons in the display of these grid links, it is recommended to use the utility `fa-fw` class to keep all of the included icons the same width. This will keep everything lined up within the grid in both desktop and mobile presentations. More from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-web/styling/fixed-width-icons).
