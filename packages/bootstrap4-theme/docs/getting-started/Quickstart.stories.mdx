# Getting Started

## Local development

The easiest way to get started is to spin up storybook as a dev environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ASU/asu-unity-stack.git # clone the package
cd asu-unity-stack # cd into repo root
yarn install # do this at repo root
yarn build
cd packages/bootstrap4-theme # step into package root
yarn storybook # run storybook
```

See the developer documentation on storybook at https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/
