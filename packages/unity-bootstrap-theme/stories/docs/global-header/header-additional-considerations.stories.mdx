# Additional considerations when implementing the Header

Public-facing ASU sites on the asu.edu domain are required to implement
the ASU Header and also expected to use the ASU Cookie Consent component
and the ASU Universal Google Tag Manager as a general rule. More details
on the various requirements and options for obtaining these essential
components can be found in the

[ASU Header guide](https://unity.web.asu.edu/asuheader) and
[Google Tag Manager and data layer guide](https://unity.web.asu.edu/gtm-datalayer).
