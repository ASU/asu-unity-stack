# Content Image Overlap

```
<div class="uds-image-overlap">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="https://placeimg.com/800/800/nature" alt="Generic image from PlaceIMG" />
  <div class="content-wrapper">
    <h3>Headline <span class="highlight-gold"> with emphasis</h3>
    <p>Your content goes here. Normal paragraphs and other content types are permissible.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

- The content image overlap element uses a CSS grid in the large format (desktop) display to control the spacing, padding and other layout options.
- The component scales at the xl and lg breakpoints in Bootstrap while still maintaining the "desktop" look. Below the lg breakpoint, it will default to the mobile display.
- Add the modifier class `content-left` to `<div class='uds-image-overlap">'` to produce the left content variant.
- The markup for the left and right variants is otherwise exactly the same.

## Other notes

The XD design specifications call for the use of an 4:3 sized image (800px by 600px) for this component. However, it will work with nearly any horizontal image.

- A 16:9 sized image will produce an available text area roughly the size of a single line headline + one paragraph.
- A 1:1 (square) image will add enough room for three or four paragraphs, but does take up at least one full length of a standard laptop screen.

The component is intended for presentation within a column set that spans the full width of the page. (i.e. `col-12`). However, it will scale to smaller smaller column widths if desired.

- The recommended minimum width for this style of a component is col-6.
- At that width, you may also need to adjust the padding of the inset box as well as the overall length of your content. (Think short!)
