## Usage

## Implementing the Google Analytics Data Layer

- The data layer is an object used by Google Tag Manager to pass information to Google Analytics based on click and change events associated with tags in your site or application. If you are using the Unity Bootstrap Theme (`unity-bootstrap-theme` package), you will get the data layer attributes without additional effort if you copy the Unity markup. For more info on the data layer, see how to [Implement the Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Data Layer](https://unity.web.asu.edu/gtm-datalayer/index.html).

const unityBootstrapTheme = require('@asu/unity-bootstrap-theme');
