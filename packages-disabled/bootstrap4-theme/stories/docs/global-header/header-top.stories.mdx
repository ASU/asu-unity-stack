# Header Top (Universal Navigation)

The grey bar at the top of the page is referred to as the **universal navigation** and exists within the `#header-top` element.

- The links in this area are not intended to be altered and should provide a top-level consistent experience for people looking to navigate the entire ASU domain.
- The first two links on the page are visually hidden but become visible when navigating with a keyboard. Those links are the **Skip to Content** link and the **Report an Accessibility Problem** link.

The markup contains a landmark for developers to target with any relevant JS for the process of logging in / logging out of their specific application. Inject your results into `div.login-status` and utilize some additional utility classes for consistent formatting:

- `.login-status > a.name` should render with a font weight of 700;
- `.login-status > a.signout` should surround the result with an open and close parenthesis. (Done via pseudo-elements and CSS.)

## About local site search

The following input **should be added** right below the other hidden fields on the `form[name="gs"]` element

`<input name="url_host" value="mydomain.asu.edu" type="hidden" />`

But replacing _mydomain.asu.edu_ with your domain **with no https and no trailing slash or path.**

### Implementation

```
<form class="form-inline" action="https://search.asu.edu/search" method="get" name="gs">
  <input
    class="form-control"
    type="search"
    name="q"ÃŸ
    aria-labelledby="header-top-search"
    required
    data-ga-input-header-event="search"
  />
  <label id="header-top-search">Search asu.edu</label>

  <!-- Input added right here -->
  <input name="url_host" value="mydomain.asu.edu" type="hidden" />
</form>
```
